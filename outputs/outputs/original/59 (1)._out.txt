Read aboutit at http://www.einsight.com.********************News Brief+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in FuelExpense RecoveryFaced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demandfor electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminarypaperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricityin 2000.
FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission torecover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that iscurrently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million.
The refund ispursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the PublicCounsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and itscustomers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years.
As aresult of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residentialelectric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.
The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since thefirst quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel.
Natural gasprices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000.
With theonset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand forheating fuel increases./////////////////////Market

Attached is a Draft Decision approving SDG&E's Emergency Motion for authori=
ty=20to enter into bilateral contracts.
The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by==2012/02.  
It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to SCE=20(bilateral contracts must be within 5% of actual annual procurement
costs).= =20The draft decision rejects SDG&E's request to allocate those contracts to==20residential and small commercial customers.  
It rejects SDG&E's request
for==20an exemption from the affiliate rules, which would have allowed SDG&E to=20enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting==20those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process.
Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PG&E=20Decisions, I give a low probability to changing the decision language.

20However, if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue, please let m=

asap.  
Thanks.

Cooke has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the August ==209, 2000, emergency motion filed by SDG&E to enter into bilateral power =
20contracts.?
SDG&E sought similar authority to that granted to Edison  and==20PG&E in D.00-08-023.?
The draft decision would grant the motion,  but would==20impose certain conditions different from those requested by the  utility.?==20The differences are summarized below:?BackgroundUnder the terms of the  Commission=01,s D.00-08-021, SDG&E is currently=20authorized to participate  in the PX forward markets for energy services,==20subject to seasonal trading  limits, through the end of the last utility ra
=te=20freeze.
?
SDG&E is not  proposing an increase to the limits approved in=20D.00-08-021 and will treat its  capacity purchases under those limits,=20although
it reserves the right to request  expanded authority in the future=.?=20The draft decision
also notes that  SDG&E proposes that costs associated=20with, and gains/losses from these  bilateral contracts should be attributed==20only to small commercial and  residential customers.?
It also notes that=20intervenors focused on four  general areas of concern regarding the specifi=
c=20authority requested by  SDG&E: duration of contracts, reasonableness=20standards, request for  exemption from affiliate rules, and ratemaking.?Duration of  ContractsSDG&E requested  authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on==20or before December  31, 2005.?
The ALJ notes that the Commission recently==20instituted an  investigation into the impact of the functioning of the=20wholesale electric  market on retail rates in SDG&E=01,s service territory =
and=20that
the OII  will consider whether SDG&E should be removed from that defau=lt=20provider  role.?
The ALJ states that, "the Commission should not compromise= =20future long-term solutions by affording SDG&E greater purchasing authority ==
20than is needed to address the current emergency situation.?
For this  reaso=n,=20we limit SDG&E=01,s authority to what we described in D.00-08-023  as near-=term=20bilateral contracting authority, that is, contracts with delivery  occurrin=
g=20on or before December 31, 2002."?Reasonableness  
StandardsThe draft decision  suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a==20common framework for all  three utilities for determining the reasonablenes=s=20of
their bilateral  purchases.?
However, in the interim, it adopts the same==20reasonableness  standard for near-term contracts as it did for SCE.?
"If th=e=20average  price of SDG&E=01,s bilateral transactions, delivered or requiring=
=20delivery, over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of ==
20SDG&E=01,s corresponding portfolio of transactions, delivered or  requiring==20deliver over the same period, by more than 5%, then the Commission  will=20initiate a reasonableness review.?
Reasonableness reviews, to the  extent==20needed, will take place as part of SDG&E=01,s Annual Transition  Cost=20Proceeding."?Affiliate
Rules  
ExemptionSDG&E's request to be  exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases==20from affiliates was  denied.?RatemakingTURN  urged the Commission to reject SDG&E=01,s request to limit the ratema=
king
=20impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial ==
20customers, saying that, "the potential risks and benefits should be spread ==
20among all customers."?
The draft decision states that, "we do not  believe =
it=20prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to  residenti=
al=20and small commercial customers.?
This aspect of  SDG&E=01,s motion is denie=d.
"?Transparency  
ConsiderationsThe ALJ orders SDG&E  to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy==20Division on a confidential  basis in a monthly report.?
The draft decision==20notes that, "WPTF and  ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral==20transactions is required,  compared to that proposed by SDG&E.?
We adopt=20consistent disclosure  standards for SDG&E bilateral contracts as that=20adopted in D.00-08-023 for  PG&E and SCE.?
This issue may be revisited on a==20going forward basis in  I.00-08-002."?Response
TimeThe normal response time  has been shortened.?
Parties to the proceeding ma=
y=20file comments on the  draft decision no later than noon on September 5,=202000.?
I suggest that  comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the=20decision, but strongly  advocating that SDG&E be required to publicly post==20its transactions, as it  agreed to do in Advice Letter 1234-E, with regard =to=20SDG&E's participation  in the Block Forward Market.?
In addition, we should==20consider whether to  refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts o=f=20the bilateral contracts  to SDG&E's residential and small commercial=20customers.?Comments or  
suggestions????Dan - ALJ Cooke Draft Decision.doc

DJ US Sen. Feinstein Urges Cap For Western US Power Market NEW YORK
(Dow Jones)--U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on Wednesdayurged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a regionwide cap onwholesale electricity rates for the western United States.
To date, a price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour has been placed only onCalifornia's power market.
A regional cap is necessary to avoid "electricity biddingwars" between western states during power shortages that could result in blackouts inCalifornia, Feinstein said.
"As is clearly evident, the energy market in San Diego is not functioning,at this time, as a true market," Feinstein said in a letter to FERC Chairman James J.Hoecker.
"The lack of energy generation has produced a dramatic increase in electricityprices with many families and businesses facing energy bills two or three times higherthan normal and has led to the possibility of wholesale price gouging."
Feinstein also supported President Clinton's use Wednesday of $2.6 millionin emergency energy assistance funds for low income households, and specialcredit programs for small businesses.

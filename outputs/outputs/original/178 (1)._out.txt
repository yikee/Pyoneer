  Market Participants:  
After yesterday's announcement of CMR stakeholder meetingschedule changes, we learned of a conflict with previously-scheduledmeetings on August 15 that affected many of you who have been active in theCMR process.  
As a result, we have rescheduled the stakeholder meetings todiscuss details of the CMR Recommendation for August 16-18.  
We give youspecifics of these meetings as soon as they are available.

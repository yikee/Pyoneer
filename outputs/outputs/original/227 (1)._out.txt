Craig Rose's article includes the price we offered to SDG&E -- thanks to Peace.  
He makes us look like the bad guys in some respects -- at least he's saying let's try to make the market work first -- before asking the CPUC for price caps.
The first flavor of Peace response to Enron's offer to SDG&E is in theattached SDG&E article.  
Brace yourself.  
Other articles are also ofinterest.

NOTICEThis Market Notification is to advise you of a misallocation of UFE that hasbeen identified in the SCE and Pasadena's UDC territories between the Tradedates of April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000 .On
April 26, 2000
the ISO made a change to the ISO Masterfile thateliminated the ability for SCs to submit a schedule at the intra-tieresource ID for the Pasadena UDC territory.
This change in turn, preventedthe meter data that was directly collected by the ISO at the intra-tie/loadpoint to be used in the Settlement calculations.
The effect of this change was that from Trade date April 27, 2000 untilcorrected for Trade date June 28, 2000
the UFE calculation was performedwithout the proper data representing the intra-tie point between the SCE andPasadena UDC territories.
This caused UFE to be more positive in the SCE UDCterritory and more negative in the Pasadena UDC territory.  
The UFEcalculation used the appropriate meter data, for Trade dates June 28, 2000forward .The
ISO is in process of determining the method to reallocate the UFE
forthe period between Trade dates April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000.
Themagnitude of the misallocation is estimated at approximately $14.5 Million .Further notification to the Market will be made after the ISO determines thereallocation method and timeline .

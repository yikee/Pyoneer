To Ask FERC To Reduce Day-of, Day-Ahead Price Cap
:Board Caves
In To Political PressureBy Jason LeopoldLOS ANGELES--
The California Power Exchange, the spot market where electricity isbought and sold in the state, approved a measure Wednesday seeking federalauthority to impose a$350 per megawatt-hour bid cap on wholesale power prices in its day-of andday-ahead markets.
Members of the CalPX's board of governors admitted that the measure was approved as a result ofintense political pressure being placed on the board by state lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis."Not
approving this is political suicide," said CalPX board member CarolynKeherein, who also serveson the board of governors at the California Independent System Operator.
"
We'renot changinganything but the perception in the market.
"The
CalPX current cap on wholesale power prices in the day-of and day-aheadmarket is set at $2,500,but that is only a technical limitation of their computer system and has had noeffect on power prices.
State lawmakers believe a price cap would stabilize high power prices beingpassed on to retailcustomers, most notably consumers in San Diego.
Ratepayers there are payingmarket-based rates forelectricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past twomonths.
The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission before it goesinto effect at the Power Exchange.
FERC has not indicated whether it would OKthe measure, but saidit would investigate it.

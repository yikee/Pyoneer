  The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholdermeeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  
The meeting is a broadstakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions onlessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technicalstandards, contractual issues, and load management.  
Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that wouldaggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day aheadenergy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs.
In order toaccelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot programto test the system/approach with selected vendors.  
The pilot program willtest the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demandresponsiveness in our markets.  
We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in theafternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to thestakeholder group.  
In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that theISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  
The ISO has  experiencedconsiderable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that wouldinclude entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for bothGenerators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining toinstallations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providingAncillary Services to the ISO markets.  
The agendas are attached for both events, includingdirections and lodging information.

FYI.  
The ISO Dept. of Market Analysis Released a rather hefty "special report" yesterday.  
The URL is attached.
Among other things, it concludes that, despite the lack of generation concentrationin California, market power in times of shortage
has been partially responsible for the price spikes.
"The
observed market power was the combined effect of the bidding activity of in-state and out-of-state generation sources....
The high prices bid by out-of-state suppliers as well as the high prices quoted to ISO's out-of-market calls are indications of the market power of out-of-state suppliers"...
[A]t high load conditions, even suppliers with less than a 9% market share can have significant market power.

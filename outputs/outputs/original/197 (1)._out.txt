Market Participants,Attention: Settlements and Scheduling PersonnelYour participation is requested in the second iteration of 10-MinuteSettlement Market Simulation.
As communicated on 7/20/00, the ISO has postponed the August 1, 2000,implementation of 10-minute settlements in order to accommodate additionalend-to-end testing and market simulation.  
The ISO's new target forimplementation is the last week of August, 2000, contingent upon thesuccessful completion of the second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulationand ISO's 10 day written notice to FERC.The second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation is scheduled to begin onTuesday, August 1, 2000.  
The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conferencecall on Thursday, July 27, from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m., to summarize the status ofthe first Market Simulation, discuss the second Market Simulation logistics,and review the Market Simulation Plan.
All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this simulationto identify any outstanding issues that may affect implementation forScheduling Coordinators and the ISO.Please respond to Cathy Young at cyoung@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on Friday ifyou intend to participate.  
The remainder of this message contains thekickoff meeting Agenda, Market Simulation Schedule, and necessary system setup documentation for the simulation.10 MINUTE SETTLEMENT MARKET SIMULATION IIKICKOFF CONFERENCE

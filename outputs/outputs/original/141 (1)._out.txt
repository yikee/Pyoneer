Market Participants,Yesterday at the Market Issues Forum, we presented a discussion on long-termprice cap authority.  
This is a matter for discussion now because thepreviously granted authority from FERC expires on Nov. 15, 2000.  
Attachedis the white paper discussing this topic.  
We will seek Board approval onthis matter at the September 6-7 Board meeting.  
If you have comments onthis paper, please forward them to Keith Casey at kcasey@caiso.com.

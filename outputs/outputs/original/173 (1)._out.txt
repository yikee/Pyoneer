I have heard from several of you today that we continue to receive Broker Confirms
which reference "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy" for deals done at California Delivery Points.  
I have spoken with Bob Badeer and he promised me that he and Jeff are going to call them as soon as they can.
In the meantime, if for any SP15, NP15, or Z26 deals we receive a Broker Confirmation with  "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy", please mark out the former by hand and replace it with the latter.
Then fax the amended Confirmation back to the Broker and say something in the fax Cover Sheet to the effect of :"We have amended the attached Confirmation(s) to show that the relevant energy purchased/sold is "CAISO Energy".
Please revise your Confirmation(s) to reflect this modification and send the amended Confirmation(s) to us and our Counterparty.
Should you have any questions with regard to the "CAISO Energy" product, please contact Bob Badeer on (503) 464-3926 or Jeff Richter on (503) 464-3720."Let's give Bob and Jeff some time to call the brokers
and I would propose to reassess the situation next Monday
(I am out of the office on business on Friday).
Let's see where we are then.
Thanks everyone, Shari  Bob & Jeff, At my request, the Confirm Desk has put together a list of Brokers who continue to reference " West Firm" rather than "CAISO" in their Broker Confirmations for deals done at the California Delivery Points.  
Please see Kim's email below.
Could you please speak with each of them and reiterate that they must specifically reference "CAISO" energy in their Confirmations if that is the product we told them that we would buy or sell?
Bob-
I will call you later on this afternoon about Pacificorp.
We got 2 more Confirms today with "CAISO" stricken through.

Mary --Please send out the same information to Western traders.  
We would like everyone to continue to consider the "shortcomings" of this model.
Christi, please make sure that Mary is kept in the loop on this and Project e-trans as much as possible.
Thanks.
JimAttached for comments/discussion is the gov't affairs' draft proposal for an Enron model for RTOs.  
This includes the flowgate transmission rights model.  
We are also working on a new open access tariff based on this model.  
RTO proposals are due to FERC 10/15.   
Thanks.

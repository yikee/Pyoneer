PLEASE READ.JEN - TEXT.htmHow is everyone?  
I just wanted to touch base with you.  
Tomorrow I will be heading out on vacation and will not return till Thursday, September 7th.  
Most classes will remain as scheduled EXCEPT Wednesday and Friday Muscle Maintenance and Friday Stretching.
Please try and help out when you can--setting up circuits, changing towels bags, stocking towels in the locker rooms.
Don't party too much
and I will see you soon.

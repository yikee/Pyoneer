  Market Participants,  The California ISO is conducting an Internet site usabilitystudy to determine how we can improve our Internet site.
Toward this end, wehave contracted with Carta, Inc. to conduct a site study and recommendrevisions for the site.
Stakeholder involvement is an important part of thisprocess.  
We have prepared a Web Site Usability Survey as a part of thiseffort.
This survey is on-line at our site.  
Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey athttp://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html<http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html> .

Below is a summary of my SWPTF, CAISO and SW IOU's meeting 10 days ago.  
The meeting was very positive and it looks like we are getting traction on getting the SW IOU's to join the CAISO as an option to continuing with DSTAR.Call me if you have
questionsTom Delaney    
602-321-5017The purpose of this e-mail is to update the recipients on the status ofthe discussions that have been taking place, between the CAISO andDesert Southwest market participants and transmission owners, on thepossible merger of the California and Desert Southwest regions into asingle RTO.On June 5, a meeting was held in Phoenix to discuss the terms
underwhich various parties would seriously consider a proposal forconsolidation of California and the DSW under a single RTO operated bythe CAISO.  
This was the second meeting that was held to discuss thisidea.  
Represented were the CAISO, APS, PNM, TEP, EPE, TNP, APSES,NewEnergy, Enron, Calpine, PG&E Gen, Southern, Duke, Cal PX, and DOE.The issues that were discussed included the CAISO's ability to implementthe major components of the DSTAR commercial model, the changes thatwould need to be made in the CAISO's governance and internal structure,and costs.
The parties at the meeting were generally in favor of:  (i)consolidating the existing control areas into a single control area assoon as possible, (ii) migrating to a common set of market protocols ona fairly rapid basis, (iii) creating a single, independent, RTOgoverning board with no bias in favor of either California or the DesertSouthwest region, and (iv) migrating from a regional advisory committeestructure to a single advisory committee structure as soon as possible,to avoid balkanization and accelerate convergence.  
Most parties feltthat
there were, at this time, no "show-stoppers" on most of the issues.
For many of the participants, the most significant outstanding questionswere: (i)
the costs (both $/MWh and cost shifts) that Desert Southwestparties would incur under the consolidation scenario, and (ii) timing -i.e., whether the necessary implementation, governance andorganizational changes could be put into place by a target date of June2001.It was agreed that the next step was for the CAISO, working withinterested parties, to provide a tentative implementation cost (bothwith and without consolidation of DSW control areas, but in both caseswith independent procurement and operation of ancillary services).The agreed-upon Action Plan was as follows:June 9: CAISO to develop list of questions which need to be answered toenable it to develop a cost estimateJune 16: CAISO to respond to the list of questions generated at the June5 meetingJune 16:  CAISO to be provided with responses to the CAISO's list ofquestionsJune 16:
Transmission owners to provide to the CAISO their definition ofthe scenario(s)
that they desire the CAISO to consider in developing itscost estimateJuly 10:
CAISO to provide cost estimateJuly 20: Meeting in Phoenix to discuss the cost estimate, address anyadditional questions, and discuss the viability and possible contents ofa Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)July 31:  
Decision from all interested parties regarding their desire tomove forwardAugust 15: Assuming a positive outcome on July 31, meeting to discussfinalization of an MOU which would address the commitments of theparties, market structure, changes in governance, organizational goals,priorities and structures, etc.
Status:  
The first four items above are close to completion.   
The CAISOhas sent a list of technical questions to Carl Imparato and he iscompleting a response.  
The CAISO is completing its response to the listof questions it received on June 5.  
The interested transmission ownershave defined the scenarios that they wish to see considered by theCAISO.When all of these documents are finalized, which I expect to occur inthe next 2-3 days
, I will forward them to all of the addresses.

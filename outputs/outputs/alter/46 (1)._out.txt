Big Bob,Writing to say hello.
I returned to the states threeweeks ago and have been working at Camp Horno with the1/1 since that time.
It has been about three weeks.
The job is actually pretty good.
I run the sick callfor the unit and do someother admin type things.
Otherthan that my time is pretty much my own.
No call overnifgt every third night at the hospital or someasshole doctor chewing your ass about taking care ofpatients.
I still feel kind of out of the loop withthe other Marine officers but something tells me thatprobably will not change.
Likely, they look at me likethe friendly and tolerable neighborhood nerd who isthere to take care of the troops and give people lightduty chits.
At least they leave me alone and give me achance to work out.
The hills around Camp P are brutaland unforgiving.
I hope to be in good enough conditionin two-three more weeks to start running up the biggerones in the morning.   
That is about it.
Wanted to say hello and defendand deflect any artillery shells you and rat arelobbing against me behind my back!!!!Fran

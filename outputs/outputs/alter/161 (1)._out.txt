For SCE and PG&E, previously approved BFM limitations are the following:SCE Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and balance of the month BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at SCE's net short position which is a maximum of   Q1:
2,200 MW, Q2 2,200 MW, Q3: 5,200 MW, Q4: 3,000 MWParticipation ion daily and balance of the month
BFM products are limited to amounts above 1,000 MW SCE's net short position.
PG&E Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and balance of the month
BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at PG&E's net short position which is not disclosed.
However it is reasonable to assume that it is at least 3,000 MW for the summer quarters given that PG&E had previously filed asking for a limit of 3,000 MW.
Participation in daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to amounts above 1,000 MW PG&E's net short position.
SDG&E BFM limits approved in Advice Letter 1234-EMonthly and Quarterly Forward Market:  1900 MW July-September, 1700 MW
all other monthsDaily and Balance of Month quantities will not exceed 1000 MW more than the limits in the forward marketsAncillary Services  will not exceed 90% of SDG&E's forecast ancillary services for the month or the quarter.
SDG&E's limits are ultimately limited to the load to customers under 20 kW. Both SCE and PG&E have been authorized to purchase energy, capacity, and ancillary services through bilateral contracts.
Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market (the PX Block Forward Markets)The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition period ends (3/31/02).
The Commission will continue e to oversee the procurement practices on a quarterly basis.
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.
SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01.
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kWThe quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the BFM participation spelled out in advice letter 1234-E.

We will provide you with more details soon.

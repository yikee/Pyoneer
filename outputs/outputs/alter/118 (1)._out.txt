UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINEMarket Participants:
Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about thecurrently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SCTrade Adjustment Bid functionality.  
As a result of the delay toimplementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame hasdecreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  
Understandingthese timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation ofInter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.
Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SCTrade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  
Following isan updated project timeline.
Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business andtechnical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration.
It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participantsadditional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of theInter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.

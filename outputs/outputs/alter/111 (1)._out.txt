We need to be careful how we position this.  
I'm concerned that this may be perceived as Enron re-entering the residential market -- even though we're proposing to supply SDG&E rather than direct end-use customers.  
How does this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received?Attached is a write-up of a presentation on making a "public" offer in SDG&E's territory for supplying their residential load.
If we are to do this, we need to probably have something ready by late August.
Any comments?Just in case you need this for future reference.  
I played with it and gave it a simple look.

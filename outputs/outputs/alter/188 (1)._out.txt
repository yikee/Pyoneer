  Market Participants:  
This notice is to inform you that the  ISO is canceling theCMR stakeholder meetings that were scheduled for August 4 and August 8.  
Weare doing so in order to be responsive to Stakeholders' needs for greaterdetail as articulated in the two most recent Stakeholder meetings on July 19and 25.  
As you know, after the July 13-14 introduction to the CMERecommendation, we scheduled additional meetings (July 19th and 25th, August4th and 8th) to discuss each element of the Recommendation in greaterdetail.
We have received many questions and requests for change on all partsof the Recommendation during the past few weeks.  
As a result, we determinedthat we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you thelevel of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of thespecific recommendations and potential modifications.  
This will allow us toaddress both your questions and your suggested changes.  
We have rescheduled these detailed discussions for threeconsecutive days, August 15-17.  
In these meetings, we will address:
* FTRs;
* Day Ahead and Hour Ahead Congestion Management;
*
Recallable Transmission;
* Real Time Operations;* New Generator Interconnection Policy;*
Long Term Grid Planning; and* Questions and issues on Local Reliability Service that arose fromthe July 25 Stakeholder meeting.  
We will also meet on August 25 to discuss the ISO's finalrecommendation to the ISO Governing Board.  
We apologize for any inconvenience this change has causedyou, but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topicswill allow more productive discussions.

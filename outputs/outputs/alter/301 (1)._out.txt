 THE FRIDAY BURRITO"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.
"=0F"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F
" he asked in an outrage.  
My friend, =
Ol=0F'Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our powerbusiness here in California.  
In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's JointSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing toimprove
either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassmentCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.=0F"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcingutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F
" he mused between sipsof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  
=0F"Come
to thinkof it, Dave, they did say something about that.
Yeah,=0F
" I recalled,=0F"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing theISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market buildthem.  
I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOBChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into Stateagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F"I
know what you are thinking right now.  
The next thing you knowCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  
That recipe should be outof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.=0F"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to theISO=0F's bid cap.   
There is no way you can tell me that a generatorplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F
" Dave added.
=
0F"So
you agreewith Herr (Hair) Peace!  
You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F
" I retorted. =
=
0F"Oh,I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwestmarket went against me,=0F
" Dave recalled.  
=0F"I called everyone who I tra=dedwith, and they had nothing.  
I finally called XXXXX, and I asked whatwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F"=0F"Why
didn=0F't
you ask for 300?=0F" I wondered.  
=0F"I
didn=0F't
want to= show him myposition.  
You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  
Ask for50
, first,=0F" Dave chided.=0F"What happened?=0F"
=
0F"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  
I said I==0F'dtake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  
He asked $300.  
I tookthat, and
he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F"
lamented Dave.  
=0F"He
justwanted to see how far he could push me.
That=0F's what I mean
when I saythe traders are jigging
it.=0F"=0F"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function iswhat mitigates the risk.
The traders are the in between people who guessat the price.  
Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guesswrong.  
But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed onto the ultimate consumer.
It has nothing to do with the marginal cost
ofa generating
plant.=0F"And there
you have it.  
Put in a price cap, and the traders have atarget for which to shoot.  
I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=lwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the averagetrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F"dysfunctional=0F" price spik=esare eliminated.  
Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economicprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with theimposition of an additional constraint.
I feel better already.  
Here is what is on our short agenda this week.
@@@
The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale MarketIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.
FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =
0F"Please
Gary=,no more whining about your computer.   
How old are you??
Is this theyear you get the AARP letter???
A very depressing moment.  
Do you reallynot know how to spell Morro Bay???  
Please let us know what is going onwith your son's hockey team??
Don't forget the cigars for Moron???Bay!!!!=0F"It is good to have friends like Steve.  
They make the pain of separationso much easier.
And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy mergersorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know.
I want toparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  
How aboutFentergy PLus?Next, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =
0F"As
you've heard fromothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this materialeach week.
The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains asprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  
Though you are usually neutralregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  
Ithink
we do a pretty good job over here
and so often people in theindustry forget the amount effort and challenge
it took the PX tosuccessfully open this market.=0F"Thanks, Mark.  
I just want you to know that my ability to write thisstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  
I havelearned from watching Herr (Hair?)
Peace, that as long as you can talk(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless ofhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.
A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.
It=0F's
okay, Jennifer.  
I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him forthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinionsare cool with us.  
=
0F"Just
curious - has anyone been comparing highunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  
What I mean is, we areup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diegoconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on.
But what about the inflatedunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last fewmonths?  
No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer fromhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  
No mention is made of thosewho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't affordthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  
The costs are passed along to theconsumer without pause.  
Granted there are differences between theunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-sideresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =
0F`Ican't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'vs.
=
0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F"Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am nottelling who, I received the following: =0F"I ...
broke down and listened tothe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  
Ugh!  
I too noted thatthe "speak fast" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  
My goodness,what a mess we have.  
I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spokevolumes.  
My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eyeout for {FERC Chairman]
Hoecker to do something really ...
[Censored]... for political reasons.  
Given no Commission meetings til September,the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't doall that much.=0F" @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB ReportSeveral of you
people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to thePUC/EOB report was very good.  
I decided to excerpt the best sections ofit for the Burrito.  
The full document can be found on the ISO=0F'swebsite.=0F"...
the [PUC/EOB]
Report asserts that the suspected activities ofcertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading tothe Bay Area blackouts the following day.
In fact, the events of June 13and June 14 were completely independent of one another.
The voltageinstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day
alone-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specificlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofgeneration from outside the area.=0F"The Report states that the ISO =0F"never tried=0F" to call upon consume=
rs toreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts.
In fact, the ISOhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed toreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, underwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtailenergy use in exchange for a fee=0F"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=1.2billion in the month of June alone).
These assertions leave one with themistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bythe UDCs and/or passed through to customers.
However, in determining thetotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forwardcontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energymarkets.
These contracts, which are designed to =0F"lock-in=0F" a specificprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, arespecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, andare standard in all commodities markets.
We have reason to believe thatsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of therecent price spikes.=0F"In
a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F"might well==0F"have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place inMay and June.
This assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap.
In fact, during times ofpeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, theISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation.
In orderto secure the necessary power
, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateralbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's controlarea.=0F"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F"are not nowcompetitive=0F" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is thenormal state of affairs.
It is not.
The Market Surveillance Committeehas noted that =0F"market power in the California energy market appears toariseprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F" and warned that demand growthwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.=0F"The Report
asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interestedboard and not to the citizens of California.
This simply is not thecase.
The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act andto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, thatwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicinterest.
The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andapproved by FERC.
Every change to our market design and virtually everyaspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by thestate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participantsin the FERC
proceedings.=0F"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affectedby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madeCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages.
This assertion isunfounded.
Significant load growth in California and neighboring statescoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothgeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications
many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F" @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate
HearingsIf
you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve Californialegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongsof electric restructuring.  
Also imagine, as if you are in the TwilightZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in theirfacts.  
Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assemblyhearing was like.
It started over two hours late.  
The Senate was busy congratulating oneof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted toheap on the glory.  
That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner BillKeese.  
Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,and he does, it is always the same story.  
It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is asingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry landwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  
They aresearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the graceof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberalreturns on investment.
Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat
(storm)of the day.  
The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  
Last week, SanDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and didnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ...
Hesaid it).  
He is sick of hearing about demand management as being asolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about donelistening.  
People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden pricehikes.  
Yikes!Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, butin neighboring Arizona
, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  
Mr. Keesecorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a Californiaproblem, it is a regional problem.  
One member of the Committee askedwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting andconstruction process?Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F'
Executive Order issued last weekto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a6 month permitting time line.  
The six months are enough if theapplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, andair offsets.  
Hmmmmmm.  
That alone might take six months before you getto the CEC.The
next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  
I went toohard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  
That was a 0.8 TPC.Sorry.  
I promise to be nicer starting now.  
The Energy Fuhrerinstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert thepass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunctionof the market is cured.  
Put it in an escrow account.  
Ms Lynch promisedto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enactSDG&E rate caps (told you).The star of the day
, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr.
Smith comes to Sacramento.  
Isn=0F't
that a switch?  
Mr. Smith came inplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  
Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese whatthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare thewholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to giveback the money
they over collected.  
When can we do that?  
Mr. Smithanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  
There is a process.  
Ittakes time.  
You must have evidence.  
FERC uses a three-part criteriafor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  
It=0F'sbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of highprices.  
You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best youcould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand fromthe US Court of Appeals.
Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  
They werestumped.  
Herr (Hair?)
Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, thatgenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, andretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiarstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  
Back andforth: the process, the process, the process.  
There have been times inthe past
I hated the process at FERC.  
Today, I have a renewed respectfor
what process affords me and you ...
Freedom from the tyranny of amob.
For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could beundertaken by the PUC.

PUC Issues
OII on Functioning of Wholesale MarketWell, the official title is, =0F"Order
Instituting Investigation into theFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact onRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &Electric Company=0F".  
I like my title better.
This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of theCommission, on August 3.  
It calls for an investigation of the wholesalemarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference inSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.
Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=ndsmall commercial customers?
(What does this have to do with thefunctioning of the wholesale market?)=0F=07
Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts orother supply procurement activities?
How should the Commission assessreasonableness?  
Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customerson just and reasonable terms?=0F=07
What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
ntcustomers?=0F=07
How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PXcoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, andirregularities?  
How should state/federal concerns be
addressed?=0F=07
What are the causes of the price increases?  
Are anticompeititvepractices causing some of the price increases?  
Are there mechanisms theCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?As

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from ahelicopter.  
Ten were men and one was a woman.
They all decided that oneperson should get off because if they didn't the rope would break andeveryone would die.
No one could decide who should go so
finally the Woman gave a reallytouching speech saying how she would give up her life to save theothers, because women were used to giving up things for their husbandsand children and giving in to men.
All of the men started clapping.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DHave a great weekend, y=0F'all

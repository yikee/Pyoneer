Peace - Writer/
ActorSteve Peace is probably best known in the KT films as Wilbur, the dim-witted, parachute-wearing leader of the Killer Tomatoes Task force.
He also wrote parts of the films as well.
Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own page at http://www.stevepeace.net?Costa Dillon - WriterLast, but definitley not least is Costa Dillon.
He's responsible for the entire concept of Killer Tomatoes!
Like everyone else here, he played small parts throughout the films.
Probably his best known was the kid in the library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying "Tomato!".
This little part was later used as a major character in the cartoon series.

   Market Participants:   
When the ISO released its Congestion ManagementReform (CMR) Recommendation on July 11, we indicated that we wouldsubsequently release additional Appendices with supporting information onFriday, July 21.  
(Appendices A (Terminology and Acronyms) and B (LocationalPrice Dispersion Study Results) were released on July 11 along with thedraft CMR Recommendation.)  
Unfortunately, we are unable to complete themaccording to schedule.
We will release individual Appendices as they arefinalized, with the intention of releasing the following Appendices byFriday, July 28:    Appendix D (Assessment of CMR Recommendationwith Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria); Appendix E (Discussion of CMR Options not Adopted); Appendix F (Stakeholder Input for CMR Recommendation Package); Appendix G (Preliminary Assessment of ISO and Stakeholder SystemImpacts); and Appendix H (Additional Forward Market RMR Cost Data Supporting LRARecommendations).   
We are planning to release Appendix C (MarketSeparation Study Results) by August 15.   
We apologize for this delay and thank you for yourpatience.

"MelLessons of the GeeseThis Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in ""V"" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they fly that way.",1
"FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the bird immediately following.",1
"By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock has at least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.",1
LESSON:,1
People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on the thrust of one another.,1
FACT:,1
"When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone.",1
It quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.,1
LESSON:,1
"If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with those headed where we want to go.",1
We are willing to accept their help and give our help to others.,1
It is harder to do something alone than together.,1
"FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and another goose flies to the point position.",1
LESSON:,1
It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and sharing leadership.,1
"As with geese, people are interdependent of each others skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.",1
FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.,1
LESSON:,1
We need to make sure our honking is encouraging.,1
"In groups where there is encouragement, the production is much greater.",1
The power of encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek.,1
We need to make sure our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.,1
"FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection.",1
They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly again.,1
"Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch up with their flock.",1
LESSON:,1
"If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and each other in difficult times as well as in good!~",1

MelDog bites threaten home insuranceHomeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered,1
too aggressiveCharles V. Tines / The Detroit NewsMetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other dogs with attitudes.,0
By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief    ,0
A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.,1
"   At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German shepherds and bull terriers.",1
"   ""Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to match the risk with the rate,"" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife vice-president.",1
"   ""Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.""    ",1
"The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- from medical treatment to ""pain and suffering"" damage awards.",1
   A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has bitten someone.,1
"   ""We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,"" said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 companies nationwide.",1
"   ""Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.""    ",1
"Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.",1
"   Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a year earlier.",1
"   The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.    ",1
"Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 million dog bites were reported in 1997.",1
"   Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat.",1
It took 12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.,1
"   ""It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"" said his father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly at the neighbor's house.",1
"   ""I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and went for his throat.""",1
   ,1
The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly half of all children will be bitten by age 12.,1
"   Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a particular concern.",1
"Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy mills, he said.",1
"   ""More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls this year simply because there are so many more of them,"" he said.",1
"   ""But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull.",1
"The increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive animals.",1
"   ""People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the mailman.",1
"Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that are suing.""",1
"   Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service now is routinely suing dog owners.",1
"    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles ""quite a few"" dog bite claims and he has seen ""a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.""    ",1
"He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.",1
"   ""There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are bitten by dogs,"" Bernstein said.",1
"   State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.",1
"   ""For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,"" said John Carroll, a company spokesman.",1
"   The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.",1
"   ""We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to bite,"" Carroll said.",1
"""But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the situation.",1
"   ""The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on premises.""    ",1
"Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- up 27 percent from 1996.watch it jeff!",1

 The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the==20Holiday Bowl.,1
"I know that sounds like, ""Well, of course, that's what they==20would say.""",1
"But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the=20Kansas game by saying if UT won out, they would go to the Holiday Bowl, a==20fun, sunny destination against a top 10 team.",1
"Aside from the beach balls an=d=20surfing, the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid=20mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game.",1
For=20instance,1
", Chris Simms was paid $1,500 by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to==20the Cotton Bowl last year.",1
So he'll really clean up this year.,1
Not that he==20needs it.,1
But you get the picture.,1
It's a way for some of the players to ma=ke=20a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the==20mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an=d=20pocket the rest.,1
The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on=20their own.,1

The 70-yard pump-and-go TD play from Chris Simms  to B.J. Johnson,1
is= both=20a validation of Simms' abilities AND an indictment  of the quarterback=20rotation.,1

Mack Brown =20=09=09Q: What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach?,1

"Up until the Texas Tech game, Mack Brown was saying things like= ""We=20could lose any game we play.",1
I just don't know which team is going to show==20up.,1
"We could go 6-5 or 9-2.""",1
Those kinds of=20=09=09comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the==20Longhorns.,1
Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any==20coach I've been around.,1
"So when he was saying things like that, it made you==20wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity.",1
"Clearly, this ye=ar=20was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense",1
.,1
The defens=e=20was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge.,1
But the offense really=20struggled to find an identity.,1
Part of that was the quarterback rotation.==20Part of it,1
"was having young receivers, and part of it was having a bunch of==20guys with low-key personalities (i.e. Hodges Mitchell, Leonard Davis, Antwa=n=20Kirk-Hughes, Derrick Dockery, Mike Williams etc.).",1
Mack Brown even said it==20was the quietest bunch of offensive players he'd been around.,1
"Once Mack Bro=wn=20and Co. decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t=he=20starter, Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as==20anything else.=20=09=09I think Mack Brown is a great coach.",1
Let me say that again.,1
He is a grea=t=20coach.,1
I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi=p=20on the field.,1
"The more he rotated the QBs, the less chance the offense had =to=20develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit=h=20learning their responsibilities in four-wide as well as trying to adjust to==20having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle.",1
"The offensive linemen, earl=y=20on, also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi=m.=20I'm sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly==20than it did.",1
Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he=20played Simms more in the Stanford game - an outing in which Applewhite real=ly=20struggled until the fourth quarter.,1
"Against Oklahoma, the Sooners executed==20flawlessly early",1
and,1
Texas got hit with a punch it couldn't get up from.,1
"It==20was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo=n=20in Austin, according to many.=20=09=09But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati=ng=20out of his hand any time he wants.",1
"All he has to do is tune out the negativ=e=20comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say,==20""We are doing the best we can.",1
We learn.,1
We make mistakes.,1
"We're going to==20keep trying harder.""",1
"Those are comments no negative fan can argue with.=20Instead, Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint=20everything about this season.",1
Each press conference was filled with a comme=nt=20about how the media and fans had beat up this year's team.,1
It was=20contentious.,1
"Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times.=20Paterno hates the media, rarely gives out interviews, etc.",1
"So if Mack Brown==20is following in Paterno's footsteps on that issue, it would be a shame.=20Paterno doesn't have one-quillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow=n.=20=09=09Brown got tough questions during his radio call-in show this season.",1
Som=e=20weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others.,1
"But a guy like Brown==20is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off==20of his back, use that self-deprecating laugh of his and then take his=20frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi=s=20team into a juggernaut.",1
Mack Brown should know his team's personality going==20into next year because so many players will be back.,1
"And he'll have this ye=ar=20as a blueprint of how not to do things, in many instances.",1
And he's where h=e=20wants to be - at a major college football power and always being in the=20position of favorite.,1
"At North Carolina, as well as he recruited and coache=d,=20Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood.",1
"At Texa=s,=20he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that==20Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big 12.",1
"Now, Oklahoma has come==20charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without=20excuses.",1
"If you notice, Stoops didn't gripe about having to play the Big 12==20title game and possibly ruin his team's national title chances.",1
He didn't==20gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in==20Kansas City.,1
"He has a tough attitude, and his team has adopted his attitude=.=20Brown has a tough attitude, too.",1
And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and==20all of next season will be the truest test of Brown's coaching and dealing==20with expectations.,1
"Brown said, fairly and accurately, that Texas couldn't b=e=20expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadn't==20finished a season in the top 10 since 1983.",1
"""How do you jump to No. 1 witho=ut=20having first been in the top 10?"" Brown said before the season.",1
Does this==20kind of talk trickle into the ears of players?,1
I don't know.,1
Most of the=20Longhorns before the season (Applewhite and Hampton included) felt like Tex=as=20could win the national title.,1
That's one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam=e=20back to Texas this season.,1
"When UT lost to Stanford, Brown emerged from an==20emotionally blasted locker room and said, ""I didn't think this was a nation=al=20title team.""",1
He went on to say the team was too young.,1
Are these excuses fo=r=20his team?,1
"If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl, the Longhorns will hav=e=20their top 10 finish and will once again be ranked in the top 10 heading int=o=20next season.=20=09=09On defense, the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca=sey=20Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on.",1
"But Marcus Tubbs, Adam Doiron a=nd=20Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position.",1
"Cory=20Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better, and there is a wealth of==20talent in the seven guys behind them.",1
"On offense, the big question mark is =at=20running back, where Hodges Mitchell is moving on.",1
He's a guy some Texas fan=s=20still think is worthless.,1
"But let me tell you, he isn't.",1
He's got guts and==20gave everything he had.,1
It may take some time to see another back who can==20catch and run the way he does.,1
"UT will have several backs to pick from,=20including freshman-to-be Cedric Benson.",1
The rest of the team is proven and==20will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end.=20=09=09I don't see any excuses for this team next year.,1
National championship t=alk=20will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda.,1
Here's hoping that Mac=k=20Brown doesn't let the nitpickers bog him down.,1
And I include myself in that==20group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact=s=20- positive or negative.,1
Here's to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time=20getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl=e=20negative angles in a newspaper story.,1
Here's to hoping that he'll take on==20critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily=20basis.,1

I doubt you had Warren starting on your playoff bound FF team but this saysa lot about their faith in Emmitt Smith.,1
 Michael Wiley likely backs upSmith now but for them to cut Warren loose with Smith just a few gamesremoved from a concussion is a pretty strong statement.,1
 Smith proved onceagain last week he's a gamer I'd think removing the threat of Warrenstealing a few carries has to slightly increase his value.,1

"Hi Folks,Again this week our own Cheatsheets.net Meteorologist, Mike McVay fromWOWK - TV offers his expert insights on the weather conditions that mayaffect your players this week.",1
 ,1
It's early but here are some potentialsituations to keep an eye on.,1
WASHINGTON @ PITTSBURGH:,1
 ,1
Saturday will bring a chance of snow toPittsburgh.,1
" Both teams will likely run the ball any way, but the weathercould reinforce the ground game in this one.",1
NEW ENGLAND @ BUFFALO:  ,1
A chance for snow showers in Buffalo this weekend.,1
No surprise here.,1
" Both teams adapt to these conditions so I don't expectany changes in offensive schemes, but Vinatieri and Christie might not begreat options in this one.",1
DETROIT @ NEW YORK JETS:  ,1
Rain changing to snow in New York Sunday.,1
 Lookskind of messy but this is a must win for both teams.,1
 ,1
"Should be a fun gameto watch, but frustrating if you have fantasy players on either team.",1
TENNESSEE @ CLEVELAND:,1
" Much like Buffalo, you can generally expect snow inCleveland this time of the year....and the Browns last game of 2000 will beno exception.",1
 Wind could be a factor in this game if you have either DelGreco or Kevin Johnson (he's not used to passing in these kind ofconditions).Mike McVayStormTracker13MeteorologistWOWK-TVOne other note to think about is the terrible condition of Paul Brown Fieldin Cincinnati where the Bengals host Jacksonville this week.,1
 ,1
Thanks to myfriend John Pflum for the insights as he tells me the transplanted grass hasbasically died and between the hashmarks is a total mess.,1
 ,1
Could especiallybe a factor for the kickers.,1

" In the meantime, here's an early look at somedeveloping weather situations that could affect your players this weekend.",1
Thanks Mike!JoeSEATTLE @ DENVER:,1
 This one is worth monitoring.,1
 The last game at Mile Highthis year could get interesting.,1
 A major snow storm will be brewing in theRockies on Sunday and heavy snow could cause problems for both the Seahawksand Broncos.,1
 Safest bets here are with the RBs.  ,1
"What initially looks likea high scoring game on paper, may actually become a ground game with a lotof turnovers resulting in a low final score.",1
DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  ,1
More snow potential here.,1
" Not a major storm, butpossibly enough to once again affect the passing game.",1
 I'd shy away fromQBs and WRs if you have better options.,1
CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:,1
 This game will be ugly for the fans at Arrowhead.,1
"Acold, steady rain with temps in the 30s for the start of this one.",1
" TheChiefs can't run the football, so this one could get interesting.",1
Carolina'sDefense might actually be worth a gamble in this one.,1
CINCINNATI @ TENNESSEE:,1
" Showers are likely throughout the game, but withthese two teams it shouldn't matter.",1
 ,1
They both like running the footballanyway.,1
NEW ENGLAND @ CHICAGO:  ,1
I think the rain/snow will hold off until after gametime in this one.,1
PHILADELPHIA @ CLEVELAND:,1
" Slight chance for rain/snow showers, butshouldn't affect the game much.",1
TAMPA BAY @ MIAMI:,1
 ,1
"Slight chance for showers, but both of these teams areused to this kind of weather.",1

"Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Tennessee in 1889.",0
The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing on the gallows.,1
"On the back of the picture is this inscription: ""Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times.",1
"Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.""",1
"After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.",1
"The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the Associated Press as follows: ""Gunther Gore was a famous rancher in early Tennessee history.",1
His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.,1
"Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad.",1
"In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency.",1
"In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing, collapsed.""",1

Hi  FolksIt's crunch time so  let's jump right into,1
our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20Players.?,1
"As we head down the home  stretch, identifying those players movi=ng=20up or down can be the difference  between?dominating the playoffs or watchi=ng=20from the sidelines.?",1
"As we head into our 15th week  of listing these player=s,=20it=01,s inevitable that some guys will have made",1
both the  upgrade or downg=rade=20list.,1
?,1
"Make  sure you understand, what we=01,re talking about is players th=at=20are moving.?",1
"In other words, a player like TE Ricky  Dudley could appear on==20the downgrade list and still be good enough to be",1
a  starter in,1
your league=.?=20It just  ,1
"means I=01,m concerned about the way he seems to be heading.?",1
"Like=wise,=20a player like WR Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he==01,s=20still fairly far down the  list of WRs.?",1
"It=01,s all about which  direction==20players are moving.?  ",1
Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often==20make all the  difference.,1
Joe?Upgrades,1
and,1
 Downgrades.?,1
Some of these  players are obvious moves up or==20down and some aren't as clear.?,1
Here's my  list of guys I see moving this==20week.QBs Moving,1
 Up?QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)?,1
We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.?,1
=20Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs,1
as h=e =20went 30 for 48.,1
?,1
The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appea=rs=20Brooks will continue to air the ball out.?,1
"Yes, he'll make",1
some  young QB==20mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as =he=20does TDs.?,1
I expect him to throw a lot of both.?,1
I almost  started him over==20Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull,1
the  trigger.,1
?,1
Manning wa=s=20solid but Brooks was better.,1
QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)?,1
Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here==20he sits  again.?,1
"It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=7=20was no  fluke.?",1
He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked==20out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill==20Cowher or  Stewart)?,1
The TD rush was highlight material.?,1
His problem all==20along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it,1
now.?==20Kent  ,1
Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=ut=20on a  horrid display when he was in the game.?,1
He's  awful.,1
QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)?,1
"Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks==20ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler ""was as pretty as anything Dan==20Marino  ever threw"".?",1
Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair=ly=20often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going =to=20have an  advantage in their cold weather.?,1
Didn't play out that way.?=20Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.,1
QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)?,1
We had him high in week 14 like we have all year,1
and==20he  didn't disappoint.?,1
WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently=20Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.?,1
==20The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded,1
 ,1
them=.QB Brett Favre  (GB)?,1
I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu=y=20just  does what it takes to get the job done.?,1
"He'd be much better off if W=R =20Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill=20Schroeder's  doing",1
a great job.?=20QB,1
Jeff George,1
 (Was)?,1
Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to=20keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.?=20George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of,1
the year.?=20Although,1
 tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.?,1
I'm =a=20Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.?,1
We'll see how==20it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.?RBs Moving  UpRB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.?,1
The fact that==20he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20more  impressive.?,1
He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to==20be  good for Sunday.?,1
"Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if==20you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=he=20stretch",1
 ,1
run.?=20RB Fred Taylor,1
 (Jac)?,1
"For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's ==20performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.?",1
You don't ==20need me to tell you he's been awesome.,1
RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)?,1
Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20Alstott??,1
" I've got a couple hundred reasons that says ""yes"".?",1
"Ok, rushing==20for 200+",1
 against Dallas,1
is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?RB,1
Corey Dillon  (Cin)?,1
One can only salivate about what he might do if he==20played  for a team like Denver.?,1
The fact he can continue to roll up huge==20yardage  on this team is amazing.?,1
New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as==20he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...,1
RB Ahman Green  (GB)?,1
Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20potential.?,1
You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to ==20be catching up mentally as well.?,1
He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20Sunday with the 2 TDs.,1
RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)?,1
So much for,1
the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.?,1
It look=s=20to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.,1
RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)?,1
"It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=g=20RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed==20down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.?",1
And that's worth something.?,1
You have t=o=20decide  ,1
how much...,1
RB Fred Beasley  (SF)?,1
We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up= =20TDs.?,1
He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.?,1
The FB  for S=an=20Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=e=20roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.RB,1
Shawn Bryson  (Buf)?,1
"Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look==20bad for  hyping him.?",1
He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and==20looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20RB Terry Allen  (NO)?,1
"Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore==20and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.?WRs Moving  UpWR David Boston  (Ari)??",1
Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be ==20considered an upgrade.?,1
"He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total ==20non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20days.?",1
And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind,1
", he could ==20do some damage.",1
WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)?,1
Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20cooled of  late.?,1
He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?==20It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=h=20a  shot.,1
WR Curtis Conway  (SD)?,1
Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf ==20resurgence.?,1
He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues= =20to improve.,1
WR Willie Jackson  (NO)?,1
"Jackson's officially moved past the ""flash in the==20pan"" stage  with another solid day.?",1
Aaron Brooks continues to look good at==20QB.?  ,1
"Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no=w,=20he's  looking good",1
.,1
WR Joe Horn  (NO)?,1
"Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime ==20recipient.?",1
Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should =20continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.,1
WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)?,1
Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.?,1
He found the endzone again and continues==20to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.,1
WR Terrell Owens  (SF)?,1
The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a=20solid day  from Terrell Owens.?,1
He's a huge boost to the offense when he ca=n=20go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.?,1
Keep an eye out fo=r=20how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.,1
WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)?,1
"Ok, I'll be honest.?",1
I'm pretty much just includi=ng=20him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...,1
?TEs Moving  UpTE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)?,1
Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =of=20choice  in Denver.?,1
His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20Freddie  Jones.?,1
You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=d=20have,1
no  trouble starting Carswell each week,1
.,1
TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)?,1
One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=e=20play  of Kelly.?,1
He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.?,1
New QB ==20Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.,1
TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)?,1
Bruener makes the list not only for having another==20solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a=s=20he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t=he=205 yard  line.,1
TE Andrew Glover  (NO)?,1
"Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=l=20of play  for all the Saints receivers.?",1
Glover made a couple of nice plays==20Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.?Players Moving  DownQBs Moving  DownQB Shane Matthews  (Chi)?,1
Take a seat Shane.?,1
Cade McNown likely makes his ==20return.?,1
Folks can hardly wait...,1
QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)?,1
Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem==20strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=m=20a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt??,1
"Clearly, the==20team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.",1
QB Shaun King  (TB)?,1
I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing ==20yards??,1
That's a joke.?,1
He'll be better but I've seen  enough.,1
QB Brad Johnson  (Was)?,1
It's the Jeff George show.?,1
At least until?George ==20looks bad for a few series...QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)?,1
"In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=ve=20been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob=20Johnson.?",1
" Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=.?RBs?Moving  DownRB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)?",1
Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is==20in  shambles.?,1
"After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some ==20frustrations saying for all he knew, ""he might be punting this week"".?",1
I ==20don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him= =20seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.,1
RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)??,1
RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an==20ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.?,1
"Actually, he's played so well==20that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=f=20his  star.?",1
"When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess==20with",1
 the one thing that's working,1
.,1
Philadelphia  RBs?,1
Forget about them.?,1
This team will live and die by =20Donovan McNabb.,1
RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)?,1
"Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind=20Terrell Fletcher  now.?",1
That's gotta hurt...,1
?WRs Moving  DownWR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)?,1
This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu=s=20as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto=r=20when,1
he  returns.?,1
He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.,1
WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)?,1
Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in==20a  tailspin.?,1
New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso=n =20which could spell more bad things for Mathis.,1
WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)?,1

QB Troy  ,1
Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self.,1
WR Marcus Robinson  (Chi)?,1
Robinson's back troubles were apparently more=20serious than  many had expected.?,1
It was announced Monday that he'll likely==20miss the rest  of the season with a bulging disk in his back.?,1

Latest NFL Player News  ,1
"Quinton Spotwood , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00  Spotwood was signed to the New York Giants' practice squad on Tuesday.",1
He had been in both Dallas and Miami's camps during the season.,1
Spotwood has no Fantasy value.,1
"   Mike Alstott , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of schedule in his return from a sprained knee.",1
"If all goes well, he could play in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale against Green Bay on December 24.",1
"It's probably best to keep Alstott on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things quickly.",1
"  Chad Morton , RB NO - Fear Updated 12/12/00  Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last Sunday.",1
We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.,1
"  Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on waivers on Saturday.",1
"Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.",1
"  Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game against St. Louis.,1
"He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday against Green Bay.",1
"He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, though.",1
"  Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek.",1
He suffered the injury during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game.,1
"Walsh has been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but he's not a viable Fantasy option.",1
"  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/12/00  ",1
The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati.,1
"He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards.",1
"Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at running back during the Fantasy playoffs.",1
"  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against Tennessee due to a sprained ankle.",1
"Believe it or not, this likely hurts the Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last Sunday against Philadelphia.",1
It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this stage of the Fantasy season.,1
"  Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday.",1
"Still, his status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to keep him on your bench this week.",1
"  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts.",1
"One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to McNown.",1
"We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing the weak Niners' pass defense.",1
   ,1
"Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00  Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to practice on Wednesday.",1
"Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.",1
"  Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games.",1
"Nothing is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer clear of both players if at all possible.",1
"  Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 2001.",1
"Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future.",1
"On the other hand, Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB and may not want to end it.",1
"Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.",1
  ,1
"Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle.",1
He has no Fantasy value.,1
  ,1
"Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it certainly showed on Monday night.",1
"Although Indianapolis did score two defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to Indy.",1
"Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your Fantasy team.",1
"   Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter.",1
"He is one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly starter on your Fantasy team.",1
"   Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00  The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets.",1
What little Fantasy value he may have had early in the season,1
is all but gone now.,1
   ,1
"Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00  Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday night's win over Buffalo.",1
"He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, missing only two field goals the entire season.",1
Starting Vanderjagt this week is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many touchdowns.,1
"   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five.",1
Translation: Avoid starting Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.    ,1
"Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought.",1
Avoid starting him if your roster allows it.,1
  ,1
"Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills.",1
"At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.",1
   ,1
"Eric Moulds , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00  Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis.",1
"In the last two weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns.",1
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.,1
"    Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday night.",1
"Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two weeks of the season.",1
"    Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in Monday night's game with the Bills.",1
He caught only two passes for 27 yards against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs.,1
"If you were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins.",1
"In the team's first meeting, Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.",1
"     Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00  Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts.",1
"These were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your starting lineup.",1
"   Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00  Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with an ankle injury.",1
He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown in the Bills' 44-20 loss.,1
"Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.",1
  ,1
"Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.",1
" His main production, however, came through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards.",1
"Bryson's 120 yards of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for Fantasy owners at this point in the season.",1
"    Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over Buffalo.",1
"James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone.",1
"When it comes really comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy playoffs.",1
  ,1
"Peyton Manning , QB IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win.",1
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one touchdown pass in a game.,1
"If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami.",1
"The Dolphins have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par performance.",1
"At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.",1
"    Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised kidney this week.",1
Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers against an opportunistic Oakland defense.,1

WashingtonRedskins,0
coach,0
Norv Turner was fired Monday after failing to live up toSuper Bowl expectations with the most expensive team in NFL history.,1
 Turnerwas dismissed by owner Dan Snyder one day after a 9-7 loss to the New YorkGiants.,1
"It was the fourth loss in five games for the Redskins (7-6) andthird in a row at home, and it moved a team with championship aspirationsprecariously close to elimination from the playoff race.",1
Passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie was named interim coach.,1
Heimmediately began holding team meetings for Sunday's game in Dallas.,1
"Turner fought back tears as he said goodbye.""I've obviously been put in a good position to have an opportunity to win,""Turner said.",1
"""This team has a chance to be 10-6.",1
That's a disappointment tome.,1
There's part of me that would like to be a part of it.,1
There's part ofme that understands why it's necessary to make a change right now.,1
"""Turner, 48, earned a reputation as a master strategist with the DallasCowboys, where he was the offensive coordinator for two Super Bowl teams inthe early 1990s.",1
"Some of his game plans in Washington were truly masterful,but his lack of communication skills and inability to keep players focusedand motivated led to his downfall.",1
Injuries also slowed the offense.,1
Three starters were lost for the seasonand several others played hurt.,1
The reconstituted offensive line had its worst day Sunday.,1
"However, therewere also many unforced errors such as dropped balls, missed blocks and badsnaps.",1
"Robiskie, 46, becomes the NFL's third black head coach.",1
He is a formeroffensive coordinator with the Oakland Raiders and was one of Turner's firsthires in Washington in 1994.,1
He is known for a tough-love coaching stylefrom his dealings with temperamental Redskins receivers Michael Westbrookand Albert Connell.,1
"""He might add a little more fire to it,"" Connell said.",1
The Redskins also announced Franklin Pepper Rodgers would become vicepresident of football operations and tight ends coach Pat Flaherty wouldreplace LeCharls McDaniel as special teams coach.,1
"Rodgers, a former head coach at Kansas, UCLA and Georgia Tech and at Memphisof the USFL, will head the team's selection process for a new head coach in2001.//////////My",1
View:,1
" If I'm Turner, I'm happy to be out from under Danny Snyder.",1
That's all I have to say about that.,1
 ,1
"From a FF perspective, I wouldn't besurprised to see the team show an uptick in intensity behind Robiskie.  Wesaw it in Arizona and Cincinnati but the difference here will the be theRedskins have the talent to turn that enthusiasm into productivity on thefield.  ",1
"In other news, it looks like QB Jeff George gets another start thisweekend after replacing Brad Johnson.",1
 Turner had been Johnson's protectingsaint so the QB move coinciding with the coaching change is not surprising.,1
See you tonight in our upgrades and downgrades.,1

"Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of schedule in his return from a sprained knee.",1
"If all goes well, he could play in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale against Green Bay on December 24.",1
"It's probably best to keep Alstott on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things quickly.",1
"  Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00  Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last Sunday.",1

"He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday against Green Bay.",1
"He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, though.",1
"  Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek.,1
He suffered the injury during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game.,1
"Walsh has been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but he's not a viable Fantasy option.",1
"  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00  ",1
The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati.,1
"He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards.",1
"Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at running back during the Fantasy playoffs.",1
"  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against Tennessee due to a sprained ankle.",1
"Believe it or not, this likely hurts the Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last Sunday against Philadelphia.",1
It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this stage of the Fantasy season.,1
"  Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00  Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday.",1
"Still, his status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to keep him on your bench this week.",1
"  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts.",1
"One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to McNown.",1
"We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing the weak Niners' pass defense.",1
   ,1
"Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00  Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to practice on Wednesday.",1
"Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.",1
"  Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games.",1
"Nothing is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer clear of both players if at all possible.",1
"  Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 2001.",1
"Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future.",1
"On the other hand, Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB and may not want to end it.",1
"Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.",1
"  Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle.",1
He has no Fantasy value.,1
  ,1
"Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it certainly showed on Monday night.",1
"Although Indianapolis did score two defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to Indy.",1
"Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your Fantasy team.",1
"   Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter.",1
"He is one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly starter on your Fantasy team.",1
"   Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets.,1
What little Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.,1
"   Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00  Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday night's win over Buffalo.",1
"He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, missing only two field goals the entire season.",1
Starting Vanderjagt this week is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many touchdowns.,1
"   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five.",1
Translation: Avoid starting Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.    ,1
"Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought.",1
Avoid starting him if your roster allows it.,1
  ,1
"Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00  Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills.",1
"At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.",1
   ,1
"Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00  Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis.",1
"In the last two weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns.",1
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.,1
"    Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday night.",1
"Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two weeks of the season.",1
"    Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00  To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in Monday night's game with the Bills.",1
He caught only two passes for 27 yards against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs.,1
"If you were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins.",1
"In the team's first meeting, Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.",1
"     Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts.",1
"These were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your starting lineup.",1
"   Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00  ",1
Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with an ankle injury.,1
He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown in the Bills' 44-20 loss.,1
"Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.",1
"  Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.",1
" His main production, however, came through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards.",1
"Bryson's 120 yards of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for Fantasy owners at this point in the season.",1
"    Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over Buffalo.",1
"James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone.",1
"When it comes really comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy playoffs.",1
"  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00  Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win.",1
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one touchdown pass in a game.,1
"If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami.",1
"The Dolphins have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par performance.",1
"At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.",1
"    Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised kidney this week.",1
Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers against an opportunistic Oakland defense.,1
  ,1
"Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week.,1
He will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.,1

"""To",1
"find felony voters, The Herald compared a list of voters inthose counties with a Department of Corrections database listingfelons who had served at least a year in prison.",1

"""Full Article:http://www.herald.com/content/archive/news/elect2000/digdocs/080337.htm==================================RealClearPolitics.comTHERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCYJohn McIntyre11/30/00For the past three weeks",1
"all we have heard from Democrats andthe media about the struggle in Florida is that ""both sides areat fault,"" ""neither candidate has been presidential,"" and ""a poxon both your houses.""",1
This case for moral equivalency betweenBush and Gore is critical to the Democrats' argument.,1
"If, as therationale goes, both sides are to blame and the election endedin a tie, then ""why can't we just have a compromise that affordsboth sides with a 50/50 chance win the Presidency?""",1
"This wouldseem like a reasonable solution, provided those underlyingsuppositions were true.",1
The problem for Gore is that thesuppositions are not even close to being true.,1
Both sides are notto blame.,1
"And this election, while ridiculously close, did notend a tie.",1
Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of thevotes.,1
He has had that recount of votes.,1

Player Updates?NFL Reports?,1
" Latest NFL Player News  Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/02/00  Batch should be able to play next weekend against Green Bay, despite leaving Thursday's game against Minnesota.",1
"  ""He didn't reinjure his ribs or anything,"" team doctor David Collon said.",1
"""It was too sore for him to feel he could play effectively, so we just gave up after the first two series.""",1
  Batch received numbing injections to ease pain in his ribs.,1
Collon said no X-rays were necessary.,1
"    Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/02/00  Robinson was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Saturday, three days after he was admitted for treatment of back spasms.",1
  Robinson's status for Sunday night's game against Green Bay at Soldier Field was downgraded from questionable to doubtful.,1
"Marty Booker might start in his place, with Dez White also seeing increased playing time.",1
    ,1
"Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00  ",1
Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal.,1
Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth.,1
Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers.,1
Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday.,1
"  ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said.",1
"""It felt great.",1
"I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks.""",1
"     Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00  Smith will start at RB at Buffalo this week.",1
"He may be a risky start, because hamstring injuries sometimes seem to flare up quickly again.",1
"  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00  Fiedler will start Sunday at Buffalo.",1
He was sidelined by a pinched nerve in his neck on the first play against the New York Jets on Nov. 19.,1
He returned to practice Wednesday.,1
"  ""Jay looked good today, as he has all week, so he'll start,"" coach Dave Wannstedt said following Friday's workout.",1
"    Dedric Ward , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 12/01/00  Ward caught six passes for 93 yards last week against the Bears.",1
His numbers were likely helped due to the loss of rookie Laveranues Coles to an injury.,1
"Look for Ward to see some passes come his way this week against the Colts, as Coles will miss his second consecutive game.",1
 Fantasy owners in deeper leagues may want to consider starting Ward this week.,1
"    Rob Johnson , QB BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00  Johnson is listed as probable on the injury report with sore ribs, but he will still start this week's game against the Dolphins.",1
"He was knocked out of last week's game at Tampa Bay, but threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns before exiting.",1
"Don't expect big numbers from Johnson this week against Miami, whose defense ranks seventh in the league against the pass.",1
"     Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Cunningham did not practice on Thursday because of a groin strain.",1
His status for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers is uncertain.,1
 The Cowboys plan to use third string quarterback Anthony Wright to back up Troy Aikman if Cunningham isn't ready to play.,1
"At this point in the season, no Dallas quarterbacks should be considered for your starting lineup.",1
    ,1
"Panthers , DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  ",1
"Not that the Panthers have been a stellar defense for Fantasy owners this season, but this week may be a bad time to start Carolina.",1
 The Panthers will face a Rams offense that will be pumped up and edgy with the return of QB Kurt Warner.,1
 Carolina may get a few interceptions off a rusty Warner but look for them to struggle to score Fantasy points against the Rams.  It would be wise to use another defense for this week.     ,1
"Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00  Look for Gramatica to pile up Fantasy points this week as the Bucs score at will against the Cowboys.",1
 ,1
He is currently seventh in the NFL in scoring.,1
" Barring injury, he should be one of the top picks among Fantasy kickers next year.     Buccaneers , DT TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00  ",1
Look for the Buccaneers to treat QB Troy Aikman like a tackling dummy this Sunday.,1
 The Cowboys have failed to protect him against adequate pass rushes this season so don't expect them to do any better against the T.B. sack machine.  ,1
The Buccaneers will be in Aikman's face all day and will force him into some turnovers as well.,1
" Fantasy owners that possess the Bucs' defense will see them help their team in a major way this week.     Ryan Longwell , K GB - Ramiro Updated 12/01/00  Look for Longwell to have a big week against the Bears Sunday.",1
" The Packers should have no problems gaining yards against the Bears but they may have trouble getting into the end zone, giving Longwell some kicking opportunities.",1
 He has been successful when given the opportunity connecting on 24-of-28 FGs this season.,1
 ,1
"Look for him to score some points this week and be helpful, as far as Fantasy kickers go.",1
    ,1
"Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 12/01/00",1
 The Lions' thinned secondary took another hit on Thursday as the team lost cornerback Bryant Westbrook for the remainder of the season to a torn left Achilles tendon.,1
His loss will force Detroit to move nickel back Marquis Walker into the starting lineup.,1
 The pass defense should be alright for the rest of the season though.,1
 The pass rush has come alive recently forcing the QBs to rush their throws.,1
" Detroit also has a favorable schedule with games against the Packers, Jets, and Bears.",1
 ,1
Teams whose pass offense has struggle considerably this season.,1
"     Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Holcombe will start at fullback Sunday, but he will also get some carries at HB.",1
 At this point in the Fantasy season he will be a good reserve back to have.,1
 Just in case the Rams decide to rest Marshall Faulk in the upcoming weeks.,1
"    Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  So far so good for Wilkins and the Rams.  ",1
The kicker went through an intense kicking workout Thursday without experiencing any pain in his leg.,1
 If he continues to kick without experiencing the slightest twinge he will play Sunday at Carolina.,1
 Wilkins could be extremely helpful to Fantasy Owners in the last few weeks.,1
" The Rams will get QB Kurt Warner back Sunday and face the Panthers and Vikings in their next two games.  Look for the offense to explode once again and give Wilkins a lot of opportunities to score points.    Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00  ",1
Moore's condition has improved and he has been upgraded to probable for Sunday's game against the Broncos.,1
 Moore suffered a stinger against the Rams last Sunday and his neck and shoulder have been sore all week.,1
 ,1
Give Moore a start this Sunday.,1
 He has been an adequate replacement for RB Ricky Williams and has been a nice fit behind the Saints' offensive line.,1
"      Jake Reed , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Reed will practice Friday for the first time since breaking his leg.",1
 He put up dismal Fantasy numbers before he injured his leg.,1
" He could be back in action before the regular season ends but don't count on him helping out your Fantasy team.     Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Stecker the Bucs' primary kickoff returner sat out of practice Thursday and is not expected to play Sunday.",1
 Tampa has activated WR Frank Murphy from its practice squad with intentions of having him handle the kicks.,1
 If returners are valuable in your Fantasy league it would be wise for you to pick up a healthy return man.,1
"    Macey Brooks , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Brooks missed practice Thursday due to a lower back strain and is questionable for Sunday's game against the Packers.",1
 If Brooks doesn't play the Bears will only have four healthy receivers.,1
 This could mean a healthy diet of running plays.,1
 It would be wise for Fantasy owners to utilize Chicago RBs James Allen and Marlon Barnes considering the health of the Bears receivers and Green Bay's recent struggles with its run defense.,1
"    Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/01/00  Robinson was hospitalized for back spasms Wednesday night and still remained in the hospital Thursday night.",1
 He is also suffering from a lower back sprain and is not expected to play against the Packers Sunday.,1
 Marty Booker and rookie Dez White will alternate in Robinson's spot.,1
 Eddie Kennison will probably be used as the primary receiver.,1
 It would be wise to stay away from Robinson and the rest of the Chicago passing team this week.,1
    ,1
"James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00  Stewart had a mediocre Fantasy game Thursday carrying 15 times for 67 yards and a touchdown.  Look for Stewart to have a better game against the Packers next week.  ",1
The Packers defensive line is thin without DT Santana Dotson.,1
They allowed Carolina rookie Brad Hoover to romp through their front for 117 yards Monday.,1
     ,1
"Stoney Case , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  Case entered Thursday night's game for Detroit, replacing starter Charlie Batch who left after re-aggravating a rib injury.",1
"Playing for the injured Batch, Case completed 23-of-33 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and one interception, and also ran six times for 62 yards.",1
Case might not be a bad acquisition at this point of the season.,1
If Batch can't play next week it would be best to plug in his backup.,1
"Batch may be the better winner, but Case's running ability makes him the better Fantasy QB.",1
"    Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00  ",1
The rookie wideout put up the best numbers in a game laced with talented receivers.,1
 He caught eight passes for 106 yards and a late touchdown.,1
 Don't rush out and try to acquire Foster though.,1
" His numbers were probably more a product of his chemistry with fellow second-stringer, QB Stoney Case, who filled in for the injured Charlie Batch.",1
 Foster seemed to be Case's first throwing option.,1
" When Batch returns Foster will probably be the third option again.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00  ",1
Culpepper had a boring Fantasy performance against the Lions Thursday.,1
 He threw a touchdown and two interceptions while completing 19-of-32 passes for 160 yards.,1
 ,1
Expect bigger and better numbers for Culpepper when he faces the Rams next week in what will probably the biggest offensive explosion of the season.,1
      ,1
"Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/01/00  ",1
"Carter caught seven passes for 45 yards Thursday, including a four-yard second quarter touchdown for his 1,000th career  catch.",1
 It was a milestone night for Carter but a forgettable one for Fantasy owners.,1
 His numbers weren't too spectacular.,1
 ,1
Look for him to put up better numbers against the Rams and their generous defense next week.,1
"    Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00  ",1
The Lions managed to put the clamps on the star wideout Thursday.,1
 He was held to 26 yards on three catches.,1
 Don't worry Fantasy owners.,1
 If your team is still in the playoff hunt Moss will make up for his performance next week against the Rams.,1
 He is just too talented to be shut down in consecutive games.,1
"      Robert Smith , RB MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00  Smith ran for two touchdowns and 117 yards on 17 carries Thursday night, including a 43-yard fourth-quarter TD run that sealed the game for Minnesota.",1
 If you have Smith on your Fantasy team he may very well seal a Fantasy championship for your team.,1
 He is without a doubt the hottest Fantasy back right now.,1
"    Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00  Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start.",1
"His thumb is still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep him from playing.",1
"Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting someone else this week.",1
  ,1
"Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00  George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated.",1
"Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and expects he will be able to.",1
"Considering George has held up this well through a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy numbers.",1
"  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00  Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland.",1
"With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and be the focus of the passing game.",1
"He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, though.",1

"On election night, the network media shamefully tried toinfluence the election by declaring Al Gore the winner inFlorida before the polls were closed in that state -- andhours before the polls were closed in the rest of thecountry.",1
"And the media all but declared Gore to be the overall winnerbased on his ""win"" in Florida and other early states.",1
This clearly biased move led to thousands of discouragedGeorge W. Bush voters in Florida and other swing states toleave long poll lines BEFORE they voted.,1
"Who knows what the outcome might have been in Florida andother swing states such as New Mexico, Oregon, andCalifornia if the media had not falsely declared Gore to beFlorida's winner so early.",1
And then the media tried to overturn the most crucial swingstate -- Florida -- by inventing controversy and scandalthere.,1
The liberal media has always been biased..... but never before have they so blatantly tried to rig anelection in favor of their liberal candidate.,1
And who knows what tricks they may still have up theirsleeve to overturn the election and put Al Gore in theWhite House.,1
"Believe me, until the last Gore lawsuit is dismissed, theliberal media will cling to the hope of getting their manelected despite the actual outcome of the election.",1

"Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start.",1
"His thumb is still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep him from playing.",1
"Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting someone else this week.",1
"  Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00  George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated.",1
"Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and expects he will be able to.",1
"Considering George has held up this well through a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy numbers.",1
"  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00  ",1
Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland.,1
"With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and be the focus of the passing game.",1
"He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, though.",1
"  Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00  ",1
The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right wrist.,1
"He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist.",1
"Burress had it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require surgery.",1
"With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place for the next four games.",1
"  Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for Sunday's game against Jacksonville.,1
"He has performed fairly well spelling fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001.",1
"He won't provide you with much this season, though.",1
  ,1
"Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns.",1
"Fortunately, linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both expected to play.",1
"Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland offense that has been decimated by injuries.    Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"""The Green Lantern"" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game.",1
"After four solid weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two games.",1
"He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly not out of the question.",1
"Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.",1
"    Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game in Jacksonville.",1
"If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end.",1
"Even if he's healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.",1
"  Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears.",1
"Although Anderson's numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of Fantasy isn't as solid.",1
"Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.",1
"      O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game in Jacksonville on Sunday.",1
"If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as Campbell's backup for the second straight game.",1
We don't recommend any of the Browns' tight ends.,1
"  Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after injuring his gluteus maximus.",1
Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.,1
" Starting Parmalee in the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to another option if possible.",1
"    Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one.",1
"Pederson was held out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the week, and looks to be a gametime decision.",1
Palmer may opt to use rookie Spergon Wynn this week either way.,1
"Considering the Browns' struggles in the passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.",1
"  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season.",1
Team president Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his first practice in 10 days yesterday.,1
Mitchell is expected to start Sunday against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee ligament.,1
"Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your league's playoff run.",1
"   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00  Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals with a quadricep injury.",1
 The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.,1
 ,1
"Avoid starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.",1
 He is far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy season.,1
"     David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00  Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.",1
" He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help his numbers in recent weeks.",1
" He has had only one game with more than 90 yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same span.",1
"If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could be against the Bengals.",1
"Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.",1
"     Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any help to a Fantasy team this season.",1
 He was recently activated from the injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.,1
"    Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00  Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.",1
 He suffered a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.,1
 If he is unable to play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.,1
 ,1
The Saints have been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who their RB is.  ,1
But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.,1
    ,1
"Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this point in the season.",1
"Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.",1
"  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00  Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes while compiling 193 yards of total offense.",1
He also scored the Cardinals' only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown.,1
"Pittman will face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the run, so he could be in line for another strong performance.",1
The only thing that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the season is winding down.,1
"   Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is healthy enough to play.,1
 He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and will be evaluated from thereafter.,1
 Wilkins has missed the past few games because of a quadriceps injury.,1
  ,1
"Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00  ",1
Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the Rams.,1
 He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.,1
 Hayes hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy teams.,1
"    Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00  ",1
It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the Panthers.,1
 Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf toe.,1
 He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.,1
" ""I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I thought it would be,"" head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer .",1
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.,1
 Although Hoover had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on your Fantasy team.,1
"    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00  Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's game against the Steelers.",1
"Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to play.",1
"Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured that he will play.",1
     ,1
"Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.,1
 He had played in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on November 1.,1
" He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.",1
 He still hopes to return for a December 10 game against the Lions.,1
 Right now he is having trouble pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league until next season.      ,1
"Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00  Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday night's game against New England.",1
 ,1
"Although he is still listed as questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic.",1
"""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) brings.""",1
"Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.",1
"    Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously optimistic that he  ",1
could return for this week's game against Buffalo,1
.,1
"Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go.",1
"""I feel fine,"" Smith said, ""I have no pain in my leg.",1
"I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  ",1
"Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be wise to steer clear of Smith this week.",1
"Playing in the cold at Buffalo could hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this point of the season.",1
"     Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00",1
 ,1
"Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo.",1
He took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice and reported that he felt fine.,1
"It would be a remarkable recovery for Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday.",1
"""If he's OK (today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt.",1
"Even if he does start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have advanced to their league's playoffs.",1
"     Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.",1
 ,1
Where have we heard this before?,1
During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised to run over the opposition.,1
 He looked slow carrying the ball this season and was replaced at HB by James Allen.,1
" With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.",1
 He is down to 242 pounds already and would like to reach 235.,1
" Even if he does reach this goal don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.      Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.",1
 It appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  ,1
"His seperated shoulder rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was healthy he didn't produce too much.",1

Meximullets Player News  ,1
"Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00",1
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and scoring a touchdown.,1
Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a thin Atlanta Falcons defense.,1
" Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00",1
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only three passes for 37 yards.,1
He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from Brett Favre.,1
"No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on stopping Freeman.",1
His numbers will improve this week but only slightly.,1
" Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00",1
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens.,1
He rushed three times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards.,1
"Unless Stephen Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action.",1
" Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00",1
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona.,1
He will face off against a talented Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the team's first meeting.,1
"If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.",1
" Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00",1
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday.,1
He gained 62 yards on 17 carries.,1
" Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00",1
"With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start this week against the Chiefs.",1
"If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still available.",1
" Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00",1
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday.,1
Look for Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday.,1
" Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field.",1
He put the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in first place in the NFC East.,1
"Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars.",1
"Don't expect huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point of Philadelphia's offense once again.  ",1
"Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00",1
"Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career game for him against Dallas Sunday.",1
"Just one week after an eight-catch, 111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 138 yards.",1
"Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future.",1
" Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00",1
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on Thanksgiving Day.,1
He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the regular season.,1
"However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he used to.",1
Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 yards.,1
Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this week.,1
" Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants.",1
Davis missed last week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm.,1
"The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, especially with the playoffs just around the corner.",1
" Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their standing with the team.",1
This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games.,1
"""We've talked about it,"" Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times .",1
"""I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a little bit, either. ...",1
"If a situation presented itself when you could put your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess we would consider that.""",1
" Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00",1
"The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.",1
"He won't continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some success against the Panthers this Sunday.",1
 ,1
"Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00",1
"On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards.",1
"If you start him at anytime during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season.",1
" Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers.",1
"While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns.",1
"In his last five contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one touchdown.",1
"Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames.",1
McNown is still another week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle.,1
 ,1
"Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00",1
"Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted yet another dominating performance.",1
"Foiled in its quest to post its record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just seven points and a staggering 112 net yards.",1
"The Ravens also had six sacks, an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game.",1
It's probably safe to say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound.,1
"Although Baltimore has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and Arizona coming off the bye.",1
 ,1
"Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00",1
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the Rams.,1
"Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee.",1
Washington will need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have any chance at beating the champs in the dome.,1

"""Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"" November 28, 2000Please help me.",1
 ,1
"As a product of both Texas A&M and the University ofTexas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.",1
 But I experienced some newthings at the football game this past Friday that my education had not preparedme for.,1
 No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.,1
 ,1
Iwatched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating andcarousing.,1
 ,1
Super.,1
 Fall football rivalry.,1
 Spirits were literally inabundance.  ,1
May the better football team win.,1
Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.,1
 I saw a Longhorn fanwith a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.,1
" The caption read, ""What'swrong, Aggies?",1
"Can't keep it up?""  ",1
Can someone explain that to me?,1
 I donot get it.,1
 ,1
"I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understandevil.",1
I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were inCorps of Cadets uniforms.,1
 ,1
"""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.",1
 ,1
They were beingspat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  Ithought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.,1
"I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in thefinest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face itsquare on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""HeilHitler"" sign.",1
What don't I know here?,1
 What didn't I learn in history class?,1
 All thesethings happened before kickoff.,1
"Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as athank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.",1
 That supportobviously came from the finer Horns.,1
 I admired the fortitude andrestraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.,1
"Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns haveMore than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.",1
 They prefer to use theirmiddle finger.,1
 ,1
Class.,0
 ,1
"Really intelligent and creative.  That willquickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  ",1
I just pray theyget an honest chance to choose.,1
I am learning.,1
 I have attended both schools.,1
 I will choose the higherground.,1

Latest NFL Player News  ,1
"Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.",1
 He still hopes to return for a December 10 game against the Lions.,1
 Right now he is having trouble pushing off on his knee.,1
 ,1
Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league until next season.,1
"     Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00  Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday night's game against New England.",1
 ,1
"Although he is still listed as questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic.",1
"""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) brings.""",1
"Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.",1
    ,1
"Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00  ",1
"Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo.",1
"Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go.",1
"""I feel fine,"" Smith said, ""I have no pain in my leg.",1
"I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  ",1
"Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be wise to steer clear of Smith this week.",1
"Playing in the cold at Buffalo could hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this point of the season.",1
"     Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00",1
 ,1
"Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo.",1
He took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice and reported that he felt fine.,1
"It would be a remarkable recovery for Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday.",1
"""If he's OK (today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt.",1
"Even if he does start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have advanced to their league's playoffs.",1
"     Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00  Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.",1
 Where have we heard this before?,1
During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised to run over the opposition.,1
 He looked slow carrying the ball this season and was replaced at HB by James Allen.,1
" With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.",1
 He is down to 242 pounds already and would like to reach 235.,1
" Even if he does reach this goal don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.      Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00  McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.",1
 It appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  ,1
"His seperated shoulder rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was healthy he didn't produce too much.",1
"    Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00  King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas.",1
" He sat out a workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys.   King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to change against Dallas this week.  The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5  passing yards per game this season.",1
 But King is still one of the better QBs in the league.,1
 He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs.,1
"     Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay.",1
" The Cowboys, who have been devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks.",1
Fantasy owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James McKnight for the duration of the season.,1
"     Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals.",1
"He has only thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept him out of last week's game against the Giants.",1
"Fantasy owners should avoid Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs beginning for most leagues.",1
"     Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00  Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 24.",1
" ""There's a chance he can come back,"" coach Jim Haslett said.",1
"""We're kind of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs.""",1
 Most Fantasy leagues will be over by Week 17.,1
 But if your team is still playing having Williams will definitely help.,1
"    Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00  Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not healthy enough to take a gamble on.",1
" ""I'll definitely play this week,"" said Owens.",1
" ""It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate.""   Owens' toe is purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed.",1
 ,1
"Don't expect him to put up good numbers this week.  Use another receiver instead of Owens if possible.      Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win.",1
"He will start in place of his injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers against the Redskins.",1
"It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day.",1
     ,1
"Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00  Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona.",1
He will face off against a talented Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the team's first meeting.,1
"If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.",1
"    Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00  Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington.",1
 He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum.,1
" Joe Jurevicius will replace Hilliard once again.     Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00  Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season.",1
 He accounted for 82 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals.,1
"The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive.",1
" Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting Barber in your starting lineup.",1
"    Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's win over Arizona.,1
" Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win.",1
" In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week shouldn't be much different.",1
Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows it.,1
"   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last week's win over Arizona.,1
" He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing eleven touchdown passes in his last five games.",1
"He will face off against a tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth ranked pass defense.",1
"Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it.",1
"     Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into overtime.",1
The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland.,1
"Vanderjagt remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter your league's playoffs.",1
"      Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy owners that two of them were for touchdowns.,1
 ,1
He will go up against a Jets' secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week Ten.,1
"It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.",1
   ,1
"Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"""The Edge"" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami.",1
"He faces the Jets this week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten.",1
"Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as always, will be the Colts' main man on offense.",1
     ,1
"Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last Sunday's loss to Miami.,1
"He will face the Jets this week in New York, which may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners.",1
"The Colts haven't faired well in the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay.",1
"Start Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's cold weather misfortunes.",1
"     Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00  Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three games.",1
 The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler some time to heal his wounds.,1
 It will also give them a chance to evaluate Johnson.,1
" Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason.",1
 ,1
Keep an eye on him though.,1
 If he plays well he may be worth drafting next year.,1
"     Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the team decided not to let him play just before gametime.",1
"He is close to being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice first.",1
"""Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it,"" said Coach Jeff Fisher.",1
"""I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against Philadelphia].""",1
"Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he hasn't had a reception since October 1.",1
"  Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' receiving picture.",1
"As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks.",1
Check back with him next season.,1
"  Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of the battered Chris Chandler.",1
 Don't expect Johnson to do too much better.,1
" He should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the Falcons receivers don't get open enough.",1
"     Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00  ",1
The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland.,1
"He has routinely been listed as probable for games this season, yet has played every game.",1
More surprising is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of center Dermontti Dawson.,1
"Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis.",1
  ,1
"Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland.,1
"He is expected to play, though, as he was also listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway.",1
"If he can't go, then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably get the call.",1
"  Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland with a broken foot.,1
"He is expected to run this week for the first time since he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week.",1
"Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job.",1
"  Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play against the Cowboys Sunday.",1
 He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used primarily as a blocker on the return team.,1
"    Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00  Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers.",1
" If he is unable to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third receiver.  Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league that allows more than two receivers.

"Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00",1
The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the Vikings.,1
Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter?,1
Or both?,1
What will they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith?,1
It may not matter too much if they double-team Moss.,1
He has been known to make catches in double coverage but Carter is a different story.,1
"They focused their energies on stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs.",1
Thursday's game could be a long one for the Lions' defense.,1
If you have them hope that they can find a way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team.,1
 ,1
"Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday night's game against New England.",1
"Although he is still listed as questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic.",1
"""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) brings.""",1
"Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.",1
" Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00",1
"An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a ""stress reaction on the mid-lower leg,"" which is a precursor of a stress fracture.",1
"He will have his leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season.",1
"If you have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not worth holding onto him at this point.",1
" Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00",1
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the stretch.,1
That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike Cloud.,1
"Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins.",1
" Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game against the Cowboys.",1
"With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now.",1
Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run defense this Thursday.,1
" Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00",1
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy owners that two of them were for touchdowns.,1
He will go up against a Jets' secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week Ten.,1
"It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.",1
" Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00",1
Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin injury.,1
"Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game.",1
"As long as Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night.",1
" Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field.",1
He put the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in first place in the NFC East.,1
"Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars.",1
"Don't expect huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point of Philadelphia's offense once again.",1
" Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00",1
Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year.,1
Nedney will be an unrestricted free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his kicking leg during the preseason.,1
"""It's not that I'm not enjoying my time here,"" said Nedney.",1
"""It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, he'll be the guy.""",1
" Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards.",1
He is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks.,1
New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff Blake.,1
" Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers.",1
"While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns.",1
"In his last five contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one touchdown.",1
"Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames.",1
McNown is still another week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle.,1
" James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00",1
"Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 2001, and why wouldn't he.",1
"He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading rusher, gaining 840 yards this season.",1
Allen will be a restricted free agent after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like to bring him back next season.,1
If Allen remains confident he will be a good Fantasy backup next season.,1
Look for him to have a big game this week against a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over them Monday.,1
" Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00",1
Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics.,1
He has been very inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of the season.,1
 ,1
"Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00",1
"Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted yet another dominating performance.",1
"Foiled in its quest to post its record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just seven points and a staggering 112 net yards.",1
"The Ravens also had six sacks, an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game.",1
It's probably safe to say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound.,1
"Although Baltimore has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and Arizona coming off the bye.",1

Latest NBA Player News  ,1
"Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Skinner was activated from the injured list by the Clippers today.,1
He missed five games dating back to November 18 with a sprained right ankle.,1
"Skinner will need to rebound from a slow start to this season, as he is averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 10 games thus far.",1
"  Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him from the Washington Wizards.",1
"He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 10 games thus far.",1
"  Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Barros was activated from the injured list for tonight's game against New Jersey.",1
"Unfortunately, the 11-year veteran probably won't have much Fantasy value this season, as he'll have a harder time getting playing time in Detroit than he did in Boston.",1
"  Don MacLean , F MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
The NBA suspended MacLean for five games without pay today for violating the steroid policy of the league and the NBA Players' Association.,1
He has been limited to just three games this season and was scheduled to miss at least a month after undergoing surgery on his right foot November 15.,1
"It's unlikely MacLean will garner any further Fantasy value this season after this recent development, especially considering he is the first player in league history to be suspended for steroid use.",1
  ,1
"Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Dickerson is expected to come off the injured list for Friday's game against Indiana or Sunday's matchup with San Antonio.,1
 He has been sidelined for over a week with a sprained ankle.,1
 Dickerson will be a little out of synch at first but look for him to pick up where he left off after a few games.,1
"    Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Walker is suffering from a sprained left ankle and is not expected to play in Wednesday's game against the Kings.",1
" He was on crutches Sunday and Monday, but rode a stationary bike during Tuesday's practice.  ",1
The ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.,1
" Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.",1
"      Tariq Abdul-Wahad , G DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"Although Raef LaFrentz will return to the starting lineup, Wahad will continue to come off the bench.",1
 Wahad was removed from the starting lineup along with LaFrentz two games ago.,1
" As has been the case for most of his career Abdul-Wahad has struggled with his shooting this season and hasn't been a productive Fantasy player, averaging 5.5 ppg this season.",1
"  Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  LaFrentz will be back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the last two games, his replacement Keon Clark will go back to the bench.",1
 Although LaFrentz hasn't played too well this season head coach Dan Issel has stated he made the original move to prevent singling out one player for the team's struggles.,1
 ,1
Meaning he benched LaFrentz to appease Tariq Abdul-Wahad who was also removed as a starter.,1
 LaFrentz may not play much better now that he is back in the starting team but he will still provide as much Fantasy production as most other centers.,1
"     Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Buckner has missed the team's last five games with a sprained right foot.,1
 He had an injection in his sprained right foot that will prevent him from participating in practices for at least 2-3 days.,1
 This will keep him out of action for at least the next two games.,1
 Hubert Davis will continue to start at shooting guard and Michael Finley will play small forward in his absence.,1
 When Buckner finally does return it will take awhile for him to get back into game form.,1
"     Etan Thomas , C DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Thomas has a cast on his right foot for a fractured bone under his right big toe.,1
 He is expected to wear the cast for three weeks.,1
 His condition will be re-evaluated at that time.,1
 ,1
Monitor his situation for now.,1
 He is a good rebounder and shot-blocker who may be able to help a Fantasy team in January.,1
   ,1
"Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Bryant signed with the Mavericks Tuesday for the pro-rated veteran minimum.,1
 He was released by Cleveland on November 15.,1
 Forward Bill Curley was waived to make room for Bryant.,1
 Bryant will get some playing time off the bench but won't be much help to a Fantasy team.,1
"    Keith Van Horn , F NJ - The Wave Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"Van Horn has been cleared to do some ""light running"" by team doctors and expects to return to the Nets in about two weeks.",1
 He broke his left leg during a preseason game against the Orlando Magic.  ,1
"When Van Horn does return, Fantasy owners will certainly be scrambling to pick him up.",1
"  Jim McIlvaine , C NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  McIlvaine did not play in Tuesday's game against the Jazz due to an intestinal infection and won't accompany the team for Wednesday's game in Detroit.",1
 His return is yet to be determined.,1
 McIlvaine holds no Fantasy value.,1
"  Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Atkins is still suffering from a sprained ankle, which kept him out of practice on Tuesday.",1
" Although he is listed as probable for Wednesday's game against the Nets, rookie Mateen Cleaves may start in Atkins' place.",1
" Even if he doesn't play, Atkins isn't expected to miss any significant time due to the injury.",1
"    Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Person was activated from the injured list on Tuesday after missing Cleveland's last eight games with an elbow injury.",1
"Before the injury, Person was averaging 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game.",1
"Person will likely split time with Trajan Langdon, which diminishes what little Fantasy value he may have had.",1
"     Cherokee Parks , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Parks has been traded once again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers.",1
He was averaging 3.7 points and 3.1 rebounds as Jahidi White's backup in Washington.,1
 Parks holds no Fantasy value.,1
"  Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him from the Washington Wizards.",1
"He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 10 games thus far.",1
"  Jermaine O'Neal , F IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/29/00  O'Neal was held out of the starting lineup because he was late for a team plane Monday.",1
 He had started his team's first 12 games.,1
" He still managed to post another double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.",1
 O'Neal should be back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden State.,1
"    Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  Collier had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Tuesday and will be out 4-to-6 weeks.",1
" With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.",1
"    Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
Sabonis re-,1
injured his left knee when he stepped on teammate Scottie Pippen's foot in the first quarter against Seattle on Tuesday night.,1
 The extent of his latest injury is not known yet and Sabonis is listed as day-to-day.,1
 He missed the first eight games of the season after arthroscopic surgery on the knee revealed torn cartilage.,1
"  Dale Davis will replace Sabonis in the starting lineup if he is unable to play.      Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin.",1
"Nesby, who was third on the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small forward position for Washington.",1
"  Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00  Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery in the offseason.",1
 The Sixers' center is listed as day to day.,1
"For those Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on the shelf once again until he is healthy.",1
"   Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00  Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.",1
" He has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game for Golden State.",1
"Despite his condition, he is expected to play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.",1
"    Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's game against the Nets.",1
" He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to Miami, on the Pistons' roster.",1
" Barros likely won't see enough playing time to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.",1
"     Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping Williams.",1
 The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.,1
" Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.",1
" A trade to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.     Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00  ",1
"Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.",1
" ""If he gets his mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will inspire him,"" said Riley.",1
"If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next few days.",1
"    Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived by the team on Monday.",1
" He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.",1
 Kerner was of no Fantasy value.,1
"    Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie Ward on the roster.",1
 Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 1998-2000.,1
 He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was waived on Nov. 21.,1
 He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 minutes per game in Boston.,1
" Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.   Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00  Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.    Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will probably start at shooting guard.    More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.",1

I==20certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenc=ed=20by a national championship?).,1
"These were burnt orange jerseys (sans=20individual name on back and ""TEXAS"" on the front), with the plain white pan=ts=20and orange stockings.",1

the jersey.=20Personally,1
"I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings==20would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white.",1
"One==20amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the==20uniforms; his response was that these are ""work clothes"" and not intended t=o=20be fancy.",1
I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac=k=20a long way.,1

Simms' big-time performance against A=02?adds all kinds of new =wrinkles=20to the landscape for 2001.,1
My best guess is Simms will get the start for th=e=20bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this==20season.,1
"Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again==20gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into t=he=20spring and next fall.",1
Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a==20rotation again.,1
But one would have to think after the sluggish start the=20offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be=20reluctant to do that again.,1
"Despite breaking nearly every passing record at==20Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his las=t=20outings before getting injured.",1
Simms would seem to have everything going h=is=20way.,1

" Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, bu=t you=20could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year==20with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha=ve=20back at those positions.",1
There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t=he=20fullback position was pretty average this season.,1
So the coaches will take =a=20strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB.,1
"At 6-3 and 235, he has the==20size.",1
He is also quick with good hands.,1
"If Matthews doesn't add significant==20oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more==20one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field.",1

"B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team='s=20second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty.",1
Sloan Thomas was the o=ne=20who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions==20and be ready to fill in at any of them.,1

 Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the==20sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer==20Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan).,1
Simms said==20both will really help the team a lot next year.,1
Jeffery is 6-2 and trying t=o=20bulk up from 170 pounds.,1
Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170=20pounds.,1

The first two names th=at=20jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl==20practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and==20Rashad Thomas.,1
"With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'And=re=20Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new==20faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at==20linebacker in two years.=20=09?=09=09=09",1

"I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis==20and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov=er=20at tackle nicely.",1
Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar=r=20has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good.,1
"So with a line==20that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run==20behind it.",1
Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges==20Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility.,1
"Coaches want Victor Ike, Ken=ny=20Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up.",1

Q:,1
Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team co=ach.=20UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams.,1
This==20year the Longhorns would have been 10-1 and possibly on their way to a BCS==20game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown==20against Stanford.,1

-Some Road to the PresidencyAl,1
"Gore is contesting the Presidential election not from clawing ambition,his spinners tell us, but because he has divined that he really won.",1
Maybeso.,1
A mind that can count a dimpled chad as a vote is capable of believingabout anything.,1
"Mr. Gore's professed high-mindedness would be easier to credit, though, ifit were not washed in the casual attitude toward the truth that we have cometo expect from the author of no controlling legal authority, the BuddhistTemple fund-raiser and the iced tea defense.",1
"The Vice President in his Monday speech to the nation repeated theprofessions of supermouthpiece David Boies, for example, that there were10,000 votes in Miami-Dade uncounted.",1
These are in fact votes that weremachine-counted for other offices but did not register a vote for President.,1
"The common-sense view of such a ballot is that the voter wanted to be heardon other offices, but did not like either candidate for President.",1
"Therewere 175,000 such ballots across the state of Florida, and 1.25 millionacross the nation.",1
"What Mr. Gore really wants is to pour over the 10,000 Miami-Dade ballots insearch of the mysterious ""dimpled chad"" votes for him.",1
Bear in mind that thecounty's board back on Nov. 14 shut down its first recount after a samplingof three precincts turned up only six more votes for Mr. Gore.,1
That seemedin retrospect to be the sort of reasonable action so thought to be missingfrom this endless exercise.,1
"The Democrat sued, forcing Miami-Dade to resume.",1
The Gore team currently argues that Miami-Dade is an undiscovered motherlodeof Gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced aGore gain of 157 votes.,1
"But the recount went through the precinctsnumerically, and the first tranche, heavily Democratic, are known to havevoted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore.",1
"While those 135 initially countedprecincts gave Mr. Gore 73% of their vote, the Vice President's share of thewhole county was 53%.",1
Those potent projections of Gore numbers from a fullrecount that they're citing are undoubtedly an exaggeration.,1
The Gore lawsuit against Palm Beach is richer still.,1
"Here they are literallyarguing that poor Judge Burton and his colleagues didn't use sufficientlylow dimple standards, what the lawsuit calls ""incorrect legal standards,"" toaccept Gore votes.",1
"Here as well we have a Democratic county and board, uponwhom the Gore folks were heaping praise less than two weeks ago, whichthey're now suing.",1
"In Seminole County, ""independent"" Democrats have sued to kill absenteeballots certified for Governor Bush, who carried those votes by almost 2 to1.",1
"Their case: The county's elections supervisor broke the law by lettingGOP office workers enter voter identification numbers left off of requestforms sent in by absentee voters, who had otherwise complied by signing theform and listing the last four digits of their Social Security number.",1
Wantmore detail?,1
"Normally the ID numbers are preprinted on the forms beforethey're sent out, which is what the Democrats did, but the GOP's software.",1
.. .,0
"Oh well, the Democrats are suing.",1
So let's review the story so far.,1
"We had a Florida count Nov. 7, then arecount, and then we let Al Gore pick several famously Democratic countiesto hand-count; we've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted, lethis party officials eyeball the ballots, often going his way by a 2 to 1vote, let a GOP counter in Broward resign, extended the pre-establisheddeadline and, let's see, what else?",1
"Oh yes, Mr. Gore still lost.",1
"The Gore/Boies strategy now is essentially to sue everyone in sight, hopingthat some cache of votes reopens (Dade) or closes up (Seminole).",1
His lawyersargued yesterday that he'd already be ahead if so many military ballotsweren't counted.,1
"This is not ""counting every vote""; it's asking lawyers tooverturn an election, not once but several times.",1
And it's becomingincreasingly apparent to the American people,1
"; two national polls put supportfor a Gore concession at 60%, a strikingly high number given the closeelection result.",1
"As to the Democrats, a few have wavered publicly on joining the Gore longmarch, but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates, on theone hand standing behind Mr. Gore's attempt to reverse the election, whilesimultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming BushAdministration.",1
"All this said, we have in fact found one Gore gambit to really admire:Identifying that five-minute seam of network time for a speech at 8:55 p.m.,five minutes before the start of Monday night football.",1
Pretty clever.,1
"Thedimpled-ballot standard may not stand up, but opening up that 8:55prime-time window for political speech may last forever.",1

We scored a major victory for election integrity this pastSunday when Florida certified the election results in GeorgeW. Bush's favor.,1
" I want to thank you for being one of the325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign atElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the BushVictory.""Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fairand just election results.",1
" Instead, he is pursuing acalculated course of action intended to overturn the will ofthe voters and the CERTIFIED election results.",1
" Included inthese actions are his attempts to attack and discreditmilitary absentee votes cast for George W. Bush whilesimultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniquesto convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.This is not fair, it is not right, and the American peoplewon't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent byAl Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.",1
What Gore is doing is WRONG.,1
 And every day that he continuesto contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or inthe media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers aclear majority of American citizens.,1

NOW!Al,1
"Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of thepeople.""  ",1

Latest NBA Player News  ,1
"Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00  ",1
"The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin.",1
"Nesby, who was third on the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small forward position for Washington.",1
"  Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00  Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery in the offseason.",1
 The Sixers' center is listed as day to day.,1
"For those Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on the shelf once again until he is healthy.",1
"   Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00  Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.",1
" He has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game for Golden State.",1
"Despite his condition, he is expected to play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.",1
"    Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's game against the Nets.",1
" He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to Miami, on the Pistons' roster.",1
" Barros likely won't see enough playing time to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.      Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping Williams.  ",1
The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.,1
" Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.",1
" A trade to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.",1
"    Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00  ",1
"Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.",1
" ""If he gets his mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will inspire him,"" said Riley.",1
"If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next few days.",1
"    Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived by the team on Monday.",1
" He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.",1
 Kerner was of no Fantasy value.,1
"    Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00  ",1
"Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie Ward on the roster.",1
 Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 1998-2000.,1
 He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was waived on Nov. 21.,1
" He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.",1
"  Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00  Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after suffering an ankle injury.",1
 He hasn't been too productive lately since being removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.,1
"   Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  ",1
Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks.,1
 If he is unable to play Doug West will probably start at shooting guard.,1
"    Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  ",1
Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.,1
" With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.",1
    ,1
"Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00  ",1
Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.,1
" He averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the Hornets to a 4-0 week.",1
" Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your league.     Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets",1
Updated 11/27/00,1
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.,1
 He won't travel with the team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.,1
" With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for Carter until he is healthy.        Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00  Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position in Monday's game against Vancouver.",1
" In what has been called the ""big backcourt,"" Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the shooting guard.",1
" Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point guards.",1
     ,1
"Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00  Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies.",1
The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring punch.,1
Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup change.,1
"      Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  ",1
Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.,1
" He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.",1
" Despite the injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.",1
" With the success of so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his Fantasy value.",1
" He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.",1
"    Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.",1
" He sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value in most leagues.",1
 His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers is uncertain.,1
"     Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.",1
 ,1
X,0
"-rays on Atkins' ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New Jersey is still unknown.",1
"    Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games with a knee injury.",1
 He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.,1
" Unless you are desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of Fantasy.",1
"     Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00  Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee against Atlanta on Wednesday night.",1
" He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.",1
"  Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00  ",1
"The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice.",1
"The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward.",1
"Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn hamstring.",1
"To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson.",1
" Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00  Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of his right knee.",1
The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks.,1
"He likely will go on the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.",1
   ,1
"Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00  McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand.",1
The fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.,1
  McGrady's status is day-to-day.,1
"    Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00  ",1
Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to repair frayed cartilage.,1
  Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the source of irritation in the knee.,1
Doctors also said they also treated a cyst near the rear of the knee joint.,1
"  Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 weeks.",1
"    Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00  Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no real Fantasy value.      Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00  Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   ",1
DeMarr Johnson will probably start at shooting guard in his place.,1
" Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.      Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00  ",1
The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday before their game against Toronto.,1
 Terry Mills was activated form the list to take Perkins' place on the roster.,1
 Jermaine O'Neal will start at center in Perkins' absence.,1
"     Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00  The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left ankle.",1
"He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.",1
"  Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00  ",1
"Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had been dished out.",1
"He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, keep him in your active lineup.",1
  ,1
"Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00  Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will be sidelined for at least two months.",1
"He had been leading the NBA in rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list November 15.",1
"His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final phase of recovery.",1
Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after the All-Star break.,1

"1TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHTMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that havenever been counted.",1
BOIES:  ,1
"""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never beencounted once for the presidency of the United States.""  ",1
"[TodayShow, 11/27/00]FACT:~",1
"Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once  on election night and again during the automatic recount.~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in  every race on the ballot, including races for President.~",1
"For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in  Wyoming",1
cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.~,1
"The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.",1
 These ballots  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for  President.~,1
"This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be  undecided about the choice for President.",1

"In particular, a  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable  with his or her party's choice for President and yet  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  ",1
So he or  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for  President.,1
MYTH:,1
"If you counted all the votes that already have beencounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be aheadby 9 votes.",1
FACT:~,1
"Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of  the certified votes from Nassau County.~",1
"The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.~",1
Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme  Court's deadline.~,1
Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not  proceeding with a manual recount.~,1
"The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.",1
" Gore won  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  ",1
"It would be  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican  precincts, too.",1
" Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,  favored Bush.",1
 ,1
The Gore approach would treat these minorities  in a discriminatory fashion.~,1
Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and  federal law should be counted.,1
 ,1
Counties recognized this and  counted them.  ,1
Even Joe Lieberman said that such military  ballots should not be rejected.,1
MYTH:  ,1
"Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if notfor the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.",1
"  KLAIN:  ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...",1
" But I think   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the   kind of end that we have to American elections.""",1
  ,1
"[Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]FACT:~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit  the recount to only a select set of the votes.~",1
"No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated  clearly that he was not intimidated by",1
the crowd.~,1
"The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  ",1
The crowd was  quieted promptly.,1
"MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law byadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected bythe board as illegal.",1
"FACT:~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from  the rest, and not counted.",1
" As a result, Bush received",1
"124  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election  night.~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.",1
" Because the  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise",1
the  count to make it accurate.~,1
The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to  certify the original election night count - which included the  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (,1
"which  mistakenly omitted those ballots).2STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, IIILadies and Gentlemen",1
",",0
"Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuitcontesting the certified election results in Florida.",1
 Theiraim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days ofcounts and recounts.,1
"As I said last night, America has never had a presidentialelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.",1
"This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,uncertain, and controversial territory.",1
"Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members ofthe litigation team who will be defending the vote ofFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.",1
"I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.",1
" Mr.Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State ofFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.",1
"Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck ofthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.",1
 ,1
Together theybring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.,1
"The other two members of our senior litigation team are lawpartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.",1
" Together,Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experiencepracticing in court.",1

"Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third down receiver.",1
He has no Fantasy value.,1
"  Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00  ",1
An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in Jurevicius' left knee.,1
Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks.,1
 Ron Dixon will take over as the Giants' third down receiver.,1
"At this point, neither player has any real Fantasy value.",1
     ,1
"Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00",1
" The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to only 57 yards rushing.",1
"Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a cohesive unit than in recent weeks.",1
"Expect the Cowboys to follow up this effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week.",1
   ,1
"Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00  ",1
"With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone.",1
Don't be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp.,1
"    Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00  Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.",1
" Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.",1
 Fantasy owners should look elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.,1
 Griese hasn't played in almost a month.,1
 A player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.,1
"      Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that have more or less become his norm this season.",1
"He is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.",1
"  Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00  Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins.",1
"He caught three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four games.",1
"Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.",1
"   Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them going for a touchdown.",1
"However, his performance was deceiving, as he also dropped two other key passes.",1
"Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much as a result.",1
  ,1
"James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00  Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday.",1
"Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season.",1
"If your league uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three man.",1
"   Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants.",1
He played two games prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery.,1
Don't take this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over the final two games.,1
"  Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win over Washington.",1
He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.,1
"   Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown.",1
The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy value at this point in the season.,1
   ,1
"Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants.",1
"He missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game.",1
Don't start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.,1
"  Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00  Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the Cowboys.",1
"He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being bothered by a knee injury.",1
Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in your Fantasy season.,1
   ,1
"Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona.",1
He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor.,1
Johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next Sunday against Cincinnati.,1
"  James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00  McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins.",1
"With the Cowboys' quarterback situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.",1
"   R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting.",1
He has made several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a October 22 loss.,1
Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder of the season.,1
"  Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys.",1
"At this point in the season, Centers' Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.",1
   ,1
"Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards.",1
Brant Boyer helped lead the Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day.,1
"The performance by this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of injuries.",1
"We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.",1
"  Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 carries.",1
"The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.",1
"   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory.",1
"Although he did score a touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball.",1
"Look for the 'Skins to try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.",1
"   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00  Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 346 yards.",1
 Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.,1
" If you are one of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to Fantasy glory.    Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00  George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game.",1
"George will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins this week.",1
"    Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00  Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.",1
 With his performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.,1
"   Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day.",1
"He also bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative.",1
"Although these numbers are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.",1
"  Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00  Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.",1
" He will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter will be up for the task.",1
" He struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.     Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury.",1
"When Troy Aikman went down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving Cunningham on the bench.",1
"With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' quarterbacks all together.",1
   ,1
"Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass.",1
"He had seven carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the game.",1
"Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game.",1
"Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season.",1
"   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00  Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.",1
 ,1
Look for Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.,1
 He had six catches for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.,1
    ,1
"Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three opponents to 24 combined points.",1
"This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham (groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship.",1
"Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game.",1
"Unless you own a defense with a better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' D this week.",1

  Player Updates?NFL Reports?,1
" Latest NFL Player News  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00  Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.",1
" Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.",1
 Fantasy owners should look elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.,1
 Griese hasn't played in almost a month.,1
 A player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.,1
      ,1
"Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that have more or less become his norm this season.",1
"He is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.",1
"  Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins.",1
"He caught three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four games.",1
"Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.",1
   ,1
"Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them going for a touchdown.",1
"However, his performance was deceiving, as he also dropped two other key passes.",1
"Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much as a result.",1
"  James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday.,1
"Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season.",1
"If your league uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three man.",1
"   Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants.",1
He played two games prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery.,1
Don't take this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over the final two games.,1
"  Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win over Washington.",1
He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.,1
"   Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown.",1
The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy value at this point in the season.,1
   ,1
"Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants.",1
"He missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game.",1
Don't start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.,1
"  Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00  Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the Cowboys.",1
"He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being bothered by a knee injury.",1
Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in your Fantasy season.,1
   ,1
"Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona.",1
He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor.,1
Johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next Sunday against Cincinnati.,1
  ,1
"James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00  McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins.",1
"With the Cowboys' quarterback situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.",1
"   R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting.",1
He has made several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a October 22 loss.,1
Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder of the season.,1
"  Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys.",1
"At this point in the season, Centers' Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.",1
   ,1
"Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00",1
" Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards.",1
Brant Boyer helped lead the Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day.,1
"The performance by this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of injuries.",1
"We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.",1
"  Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 carries.",1
"The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.",1
"   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00  Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory.",1

 Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.,1
" If you are one of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to Fantasy glory.    Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00  George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this week's game against Dallas.",1
 The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game.,1
"George will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins this week.",1
"    Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00  Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.",1
" He gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.",1
 With his performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.,1
"   Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00  ",1
"Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day.",1
"He also bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative.",1
"Although these numbers are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.",1
"  Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00  Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.",1
" He will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter will be up for the task.",1
 ,1
He struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.,1
"    Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury.,1
"When Troy Aikman went down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving Cunningham on the bench.",1
"With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' quarterbacks all together.",1
   ,1
"Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass.",1
"He had seven carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the game.",1
"Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game.",1
"Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season.",1
"   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00  Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.",1
 ,1
Look for Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.,1
 He had six catches for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.,1
    ,1
"Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00",1
 ,1
"The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three opponents to 24 combined points.",1
"This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham (groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship.",1
"Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game.",1
"Unless you own a defense with a better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' D this week.",1
"   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00  Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a losing cause Sunday.",1
 He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.,1
 Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.,1
"    Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday against Jacksonville.,1
"The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times.",1
Mitchell should still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.,1
"  Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh.",1
"He has now been successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys.",1
"Unless you have one of the league's top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.",1
"    Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00  ",1
Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during Sunday's game against San Diego.,1
"He had six catches for 80 yards and a touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go).",1
"Although it looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers.",1
Give him consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.,1

=20Hi  FolksBefore we get  started...,1
Congratulations on being in  the playoff hunt.?,1
That's something to be prou=d=20of.?,1
You have to be,1
a  little bit lucky to get this far but don't hesitate =to=20pat yourself on the back  as skill plays a huge part.?,1
"Judging from the=20emails, tons of you are still  in mix.?",1
Don't forget about our Wall of=20Champions feature  where we'll showcase league winners.?,1
Stay tuned for mor=e =20details.,1
It's crunch time so  let's jump right into,1
our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20Players.?,1
"As we head down the  final weekend for many teams, identifying=20those players moving up or down can be  the difference between?dominating==20your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in  the money.?",1
"As we head into our  16=th=20week of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable that some guys  will have= made=20both the upgrade or downgrade list.?",1
"Make sure you understand, what we=01,r=e =20talking about is players that are moving.?",1
" In other words, a player like T=E=20Ricky Dudley could appear on the  downgrade list and still be good enough t=o=20be a starter in your league.?",1
"It just means I=01,m concerned about the  way= he=20seems to be heading.?",1
" Likewise, a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t=he=20upgrade list even  though he=01,s still fairly far down the list of WRs.?",1
"I=t=01,s=20all about which direction players  are moving.?",1
Keeping an eye on these =20trends as they can very often make all the difference.,1
Joe?Upgrades and  Downgrades.?,1
Some of these  players are obvious moves up or==20down and some aren't as clear.?,1
Here's my  list of guys I see moving this==20week.,1
QBs Moving  Up?QB Jeff Garcia (SF)?  Cheatsheets.net Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to==20roll.?,1
No  coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we=ek.,1
QB Donovan McNabb (Phi)?,1
Mixed  emotions here as I've been hyping McNabb fo=r=20weeks as the guy carrying the  Eagles offense.?,1
But seeing him on my=20opponent's roster in the FanEx  playoffs yesterday was less than heartening==20throwing for 4 TDs and 390  yards.?,1
Just be aware the Eagles are off this==20week and won't return till  week 17.?=20QB Jon Kitna (Sea)?,1
"Like Mike  Holmgren, maybe I've been too critical of=20Kitna.?",1
"He continues to play well  and while it likely won't be in Seattle,==20he looks like a starter for some team  in",1
2001.QB,1
Aaron Brooks (NO)?,1
"A telling  mark of a great QB is how he performs when==20he comes with less than his ""A""  game.?",1
Brooks looked much less in synch=20Sunday and clearly struggled at  times making a few bad throws and missing==20open receivers.?,1
Yet he hung in  and still posted outstanding numbers.?,1
His==20108 rushing yards quietly add to  the points.?,1
He's a player.?,1
I'm starting==20him with,1
few  ,1
reservations.?=20QB Kerry Collins (NYG)?,1
You  have to believe his confidence is sky high.?,1
H=e=20obviously benefited from  the return of Ike Hilliard (who looked very good)=?=20This team is looking  very tough and very balanced right now.?,1
The running==20game is just good  enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so=20dominant that it hurts,1
the  QB.QB Mark Brunell (Jac)?,1
It's  really weird.?,1
"When the hype finally subsides==20about this guy, he starts  delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype.?",1
Go==20figure.?=20QB Kurt Warner (StL)?,1
This may  have been the greatest QB performance in th=e=20history of the league without  scoring a TD.?,1
The guy was incredible=20completing 84% of his passes (27 of  32)?,1
Completing 84% with an average pa=ss=20of 12.8 yards is sick.?,1
The  TDs will come as Warner looked as good as I've==20ever seen him placing the ball  perfectly and directing his offense.,1
QB Ray Lucas (NYJ)?,1
Keep an eye  on Vinnie's groin.?,1
"Better yet, watch the==20injury reports for news on  Vinnie's groin.?",1
That's better.?,1
We should know==20more soon,1
but,1
"if it's  serious, Lucas will get the start.?RBs Moving UpRB Marshall Faulk (StL)?",1
I know  you don't need me to list him here but it'=s=20worth noting I think he may be the  best player in the league,1
right now.?==20Martz fed him the ball 25 times and  he delivered.,1
RB Eddie George (Ten)?,1
George  showed outstanding pass receiving skills and==20added 2 receiving TDs to go with  his rushing TD.?,1
He reinjured his sore to=e=20but looks to be ok.?,1
Keep  an eye on it though.,1
RB Fred Taylor (Jac)?,1
What a  ,1
shocker.?,1
Taylor runs wild again as we=20predicted.?,1
He did tweak a knee  so watch that,1
but,1
"if he can go full speed,==20he's a no brainer starter against  just about anyone.",1
RB James Allen (Chi)?,1
"If  departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was==20dead (don't get excited Bears  fans, he's not), he'd be spinning in his gra=ve=20to see Allen garner 37 carries  Sunday.? Be a little leery though as a 2.6==20ypc carry average only works  when you carry the ball a ton.?=20RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?",1
"After  fading badly, Prentice comes roaring back==20with a 2 TD performance.?",1
He only  had 46 yards on 17 attempts but the TDs==20are huge.?,1
The Brown offense  featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson==20occasionally at QB but they looked  much better.,1
RB Mike Anderson (Den)?,1
What  else can you say??,1
The Denver OL is having=20another Pro Bowl season.,1
?,1
 Anderson is a must start vs any team right now.,1
RB Ahman Green (GB)?,1
I'm very  nervous if I'm Dorsey Levens,1
right now.?=20Green,1
's been an offensive stalwart  carrying the load week after,1
week.?=20Everyone always knew he had the  potential to be this good but now he's=20delivering.,1
RB Emmitt Smith (Dal)?,1
"As was  mentioned on the broadcast yesterday, ""Someo=ne=20forgot to tell the Redskins",1
"this  game is a rivalry""?",1
You know the Cowboys==20and Emmitt in particular had to  enjoy humiliating the Redskins.?,1
It would =be=20a bold move even for him but I  wouldn't be surprised in the least to see==20Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie  before his obligatory three games are up.=?=20RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)?,1
"Once  again, Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes==20me look bad for dissing him this  Summer...?",1
"Against the Cardinals this wee=k,=20he has the chance to be even  better.",1
RB Warrick Dunn (TB)?,1
"If Dunn  had any help, the Bucs would scary.?",1
"Right==20now, he's doing it all by  himself.?",1
Which probably isn't a bad thing for==20Dunn owners.,1
RB Tony Richardson (KC)?,1
 Richardson netted 5.2 ypc on 17 carries.?,1
Donnell==20Bennett looks to have  cartilage damage to his knee so Richardson's workloa=d=20should increase.?,1
 It's a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther=20Cunningham to give Richardson  more looks.,1
RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car)?,1
 ,1
Don't hold your breath but Biakabutuka is==20making noises about returning to the  lineup this week.?,1
We'll see...RB Terry Allen (NO)?,1
"In a  lesser version of Denver's OL, it appears most==20anyone can run effectively behind  these guys.?",1
Allen looked rejuvenated=20Sunday and should only get better as  he gets familiar with the system.,1
RB Chris Warren (Phi)?,1
"Remember  that he's off this week but if your league==20runs through week 17, he could be a  ",1
factor.?=20?WRs,1
Moving UpWR Sean Dawkins (Sea)?,1
?,1
 Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong=20numbers.?,1
As is Jon  Kitna.,1
?,1
Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could=20continue his  roll.,1
WR Torrance Small / Charles Johnson  (Phi)?,1
Look what QB Donovan McNabb can==20do when his WRs decide to  show up.?,1
"If they can continue to play well, thi=s=20team could be  scary.?",1
Remember they're off this week but return in week 17=.WR Amani Toomer (NYG)?,1
"Of the resurging Giants,  Toomer's leading the=20charge.?",1
He's making plays all over the field and even  had a nice run agai=n.WR Terrell Owens (SF)?,1
The  scary part is he could have been even better th=an=20the 129 yard / 1 TD  performance Sunday.?,1
He looked very good coming back==20from the toe injury  and should only get better.?,1
The 49ers are trying to==20nail down their WR  corps for 2001 and Owens is making a statement.,1
WR Ed McCaffrey (Den)?,1
It's  easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod==20Smith but the truth of the matter  is that they're both excellent WRs.?,1
I==20love McCaffrey and his 6th grade  shoulder pads.?,1
He's the anti-Eric=20Dickerson when it comes to pads (or lack  thereof)?,1
Easy Ed goes with prett=y=20much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder  pads and that's it.?,1
"Oh yeah, he's al=so=20a great WR...WR Darrell Jackson (Sea)?",1
 ,1
Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and=20delivered.?,1
I see few reasons  why he won't continue to shine.,1
WR Torry Holt (StL)?,1
"It's tough  to predict which Ram WR will catch the=20passes from Warner but as I said several  weeks ago, Holt may be the best W=R=20on the team.?",1
And that's no sleight to  Isaac Bruce - Holt's,1
that good.?=20WR Terry Glenn (NE)?,1
?,1
 ,1
Glenn's putting together one of his most complete=20seasons.?,1
And Bledsoe's  continuing to play pretty good football which help=s.,1
WR Willie Jackson (NO)?,1
1  catch.?,1
1 TD.?,1
You gotta like a guy who gets rig=ht=20to the point.?,1
 ,1
Joe Horn is the clear #1 threat but Jackson is a serious=20option too.,1
WR Germane Crowell (Det)?,1
This  didn't look like a guy returning from a=20broken leg.?,1
He should continue to  get better as he becomes more involved =in=20the flow of things.=20WR Bobby Shaw (Pit)?,1
"It seems  hard to believe, but Bobby Shaw is a=20legitimate starter in many leagues.?  ",1
He's getting lots of looks and the=20Steeler are throwing,1
the ball.=20WR,1
Ike Hilliard (NYG)?,1
Hilliard  looked well rested as he roared back onto==20the scene.?,1
An sprained knee  suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa=se=20Hilliard's playing time even  further.,1
WR Donald Hayes (Car)?,1
Hayes  looked better as expected and turned in a nic=e=20game catching 5 passes for 77  yards.?,1
"The Panthers need to remain focused==20but if they can, Hayes could  contribute.?TEs",1
Moving UpTE Johnny McWilliams (Min)?,1
 McWilliams again was active catching 5 passes==20for 53 yards.?,1
I like any  receiver on this team.,1
TE Andrew Glover (NO)?,1
Glover's  starting to become a very integral part of==20the New Orleans passing game.?,1
" It's hard to imagine this team losing=20Ricky?Williams, Jeff Blake and Cam  Cleeland.",1
TE Kris Mangum (Car)?,1
He's no  Wesley Walls but he's more than adequate.,1
TE Greg Clark (SF)?,1
He only had  24 yards but the 4 receptions were a nice==20bonus.?=20?QBs Moving  DownQB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?,1
The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the ==20guy we remembered.?,1
This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the= =20dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential.,1
QB Jeff  George (Was)?,1
I've gotta say I'm really surprised George didn't ==20post some great numbers.,1
?,1
Albert Connell isn't nearly as good as he thinks ==20he is and that may be part of the problem.,1
QB Steve  Beuerlein (Car)?,1
It's clear to everyone that 1999 was a career ==20year.?,1
He's still subject to a great game here and there but he's just too ==20streaky to lean very heavily on.,1
QB Shaun  King (TB)?,1
This guy just isn't very good.,1
QB Charlie  Batch (Det)?,1
I've never been a big Charlie Batch fan although==20he's  certainly had his days.?,1

I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve ==20Young a call.?,1

", the U.S. Supreme Court will throw out theunwarranted decision of the Florida Supreme Court to forcenew recounts of the so-called ""undervote.""",1

I'd hate to thinkof our next president being decided by Democrat activistsdivining the intent of voters who didn't cast a clear vote.,1
"Unfortunately, even if the Supreme Court rules against Al Goretoday or tomorrow, many of his supporters are urging that hestill refuse to concede.",1
"In fact, the Washington Times reports that former New York Gov.Mario Cuomo, wants the Gore camp to focus on persuading two orthree Republican electors to defect from Mr. Bush.",1
That wouldresult in a tie in the Electoral College or even a win forMr. Gore.,1
"Here is what Mr. Cuomo had to say:""There's no guarantee that three or four electors who werepreviously supposed to vote for Bush wouldn't turn around, outof anger and confusion, perhaps, and say, we're going to gowith Al Gore,"" he said.",1
"Mr. Cuomo openly suggested that if Mr. Gore loses the U.S.Supreme Court case, the next step for Democrats ""could be toconvince some electors previously thought to be committed toBush.",1
"You only need three to make Al Gore president, even ifhe loses Florida.",1
Think about that.,1
"""My",1
"friend, regardless of whether or not Al Gore officiallysupports these actions, there will likely be many attempts tosway individual electors to overturn the certified electionresults.",1

 Latest NFL Player News  ,1
"Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Dixon was suspended for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh for missing a team meeting earlier in the week.",1
He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.,1
   ,1
"Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Greisen replaced an injured Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's game at Jacksonville.",1
The second-year quarterback completed 4-of-7 passes for 46 yards and a touchdown in his short appearance in the game.,1
"With the Cardinals' season lost, Greisen could get some serious playing time in Arizona's last two games, but he is still not a viable Fantasy option at this point in the season.",1
    ,1
"Dave Brown , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
Brown started for the injured Jake Plummer against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.,1
"He was ineffective for the most part, throwing for only 135 yards and an interception before leaving the game with a bruised right index finger.",1
"Whether it is Plummer, Brown or Chris Greisen under center for Arizona next week, it is imperative to avoid any Cardinals' quarterback at this point in the season.",1
"      Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Plummer, still suffering from bruised ribs, missed Sunday's game against the Jaguars.",1
He was replaced in the starting lineup by Dave Brown.,1
"The Cardinals face off against the Ravens and their top-rated defense next week, so even if Plummer is healthy, he shouldn't be considered a starter for your Fantasy team.",1
  ,1
"Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00  McNabb was brilliant in Sunday's blowout win over the Browns.",1
" He threw for 390 yards and four touchdowns, proving that he is not strictly a running quarterback.",1
"It was one of McNabb's best all-around performances, and it likely helped many Fantasy owners advance in their league's playoffs.",1
"Unfortunately for those same owners, McNabb and the Eagles have a late season bye next week, so you will need to look elsewhere for a quarterback in your quest for the Fantasy championship.    ",1
"Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  ",1
The Seahawks' defense lost three players to injury in Sunday's loss to the Broncos.,1
"Safety Jay Bellamy (lower back cramps), defensive end Lamar King (shoulder) and defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy (thumb) all left the game with various injuries.",1
"At this point of the Fantasy season, you should avoid starting the Seahawks' defense at all costs.",1
    ,1
"Jets , DT NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00",1
 ,1
"The Jets' defense put up a good fight against the Raiders on Sunday night, but were hurt by turnovers which kept them on the field for a good portion of the game.",1
The 31 points they gave up to Oakland was only one more than the total points they had allowed in the previous three weeks.,1
Expect a better performance next week against the Lions - especially if the weather is cold at the Meadowlands.,1
"On the injury front, defensive lineman Rick Lyle broke his leg against the Raiders and will be lost for the season.",1
"     Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00  Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.",1
 He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions.,1
"With only two games remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap of the year - and maybe his career.",1
Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.,1
"   Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00  Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of Sunday's game at Oakland.",1
Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's final quarter.,1
"  Torry Holt , WR STL - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00  On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards.",1
"With Kurt Warner returning to form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.",1
"  Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards.",1
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for the Fantasy playoffs.,1
"       Jacquez Green , WR TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/10/00  ",1
The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami.,1
"After some early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any Fantasy team during the postseason.",1
"      Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland.",1
Lucas threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.,1
"   Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble.",1
"If you advance to the next round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's recent resurgence.",1
  ,1
"James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 12/10/00  Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown on 37 carries.",1
He also caught a TD pass.,1
"Allen played well against the lowly Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a Fantasy starter during the postseason.",1
"    Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00  Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards on 10 carries.",1
"Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time seriously slip in the final two games.",1
"  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00  ",1
The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries.,1
Don't trust him during these important final weeks.,1
Dayne has been much too inconsistent this season.,1
"  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00  On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown.",1
"Smith looked like he was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from them.",1
He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.,1
"  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00  On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard.",1
"If Jake Plummer continues to battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman.",1
Thomas Jones also looked good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final two games.,1
"  Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00  On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns.",1
"As expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.",1
"   Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 56 yards.",1
He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the season's final two games.    ,1
"Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two more scores.",1
George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship teams this year.,1
"   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 12/10/00  ",1
The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown.,1
He appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.,1
      ,1
"Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00  ",1
Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after injuring his right knee.,1
He was taken to the locker room for further examnination.,1
"  David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00  On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown.",1
"Patten has showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when healthy.",1
"      Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00  ",1
The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards.,1
"Trent Dilfer appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.",1
"   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FDIC Updated 12/10/00  In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.",1
The veteran QB might continue to perform well in New England's final two games.,1
"   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00  On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown.",1
"Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down at a crucial time of year.",1
   ,1
"Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards.",1
The Cincinnati RB still has a tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.,1
  ,1
"Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00  ",1
Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.,1

Latest NFL Player News  ,1
"Chris Warren , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00  ",1
"Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on Saturday.",1
"Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday.",1
"We wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, however.",1
  ,1
"Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00",1
 ,1
"Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver.",1
Watters is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.,1
"  Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week.",1
"Seattle should roll up good numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the year.",1
"   Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00  Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long.",1
"But the Broncos' pass defense is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a chance to shine this week.",1
   ,1
"Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week.",1
"Last time the Seahawks faced Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.",1
"  John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Carney won't be much of a factor this week.",1
San Diego will have a very hard time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.,1
"  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Jones might have a quiet outing this week.",1
Baltimore is very aware he is San Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.,1
"  Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Don't expect much from Fletcher this week.,1
The true strength of Baltimore's defense is its ability to squash the run.,1
The Ravens have shut down much more decorated backs all season long.,1
"   Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more problems on Sunday.",1
The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers.,1
Under no cirumstances should you start him.,1
    ,1
"Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.",1
   ,1
"Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week.,1
"Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.",1
"  Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week.,1
He will be too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key third-down target.,1
"  Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week.,1
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets in the red zone.,1
"   Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Expect a big game from Brown this week.",1
"Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.",1
"  Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week.",1
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may need to use Crockett often against the Jets.,1
"   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00  Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week.",1
"Look for him to pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim Brown.",1
   ,1
"Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week.,1
Watters totaled more than 200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.,1
   ,1
"Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against the Panthers.,1
Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on Steve Beuerlein.,1
"  Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week.",1
The Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few chances to kick against Carolina.,1
"  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00  Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week.",1
"He is an accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.",1
"  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez.",1
"Look for the superstar TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not be able to contain him over the middle.",1
  ,1
"Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week.,1
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep routes.,1
"  Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina.",1
He should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.,1
"  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his injured right leg.,1
"An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said.",1
His injury is officially listed as a strained upper calf.,1
Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants defense.,1
"  Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week.,1
The Broncos will have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.,1
  ,1
"Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently.",1
"He should perform well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the middle.",1
"     Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00  Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week.",1
"He should put up good numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.",1
"   Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to play Sunday.",1
"Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown.",1
"  Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last week.",1
"He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore defense.",1
"  Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Anders has lost the starting halfback job.",1
"Tony Richardson will reclaim that spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback.",1
Frank Moreau will be used in short-yardage situations.,1
"Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas City RBs.",1

"Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.",1
"  Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week.,1
He will be too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key third-down target.,1
"  Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week.,1
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets in the red zone.,1
"   Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  Expect a big game from Brown this week.",1
"Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.",1
"  Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week.",1
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may need to use Crockett often against the Jets.,1
"   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00  Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week.",1
"Look for him to pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim Brown.",1
   ,1
"Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week.,1
Watters totaled more than 200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.,1
   ,1
"Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against the Panthers.,1
Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on Steve Beuerlein.,1
"  Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week.",1
The Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few chances to kick against Carolina.,1
"  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00  Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week.",1
"He is an accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.",1
"  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez.",1
"Look for the superstar TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not be able to contain him over the middle.",1
"  Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week.,1
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep routes.,1
"  Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00  Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina.",1
He should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.,1
"  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his injured right leg.,1
"An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said.",1
His injury is officially listed as a strained upper calf.,1
Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants defense.,1
  ,1
"Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week.",1
The Broncos will have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.,1
"  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently.",1
"He should perform well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the middle.",1
"     Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00  Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week.",1
"He should put up good numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.",1
"   Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to play Sunday.,1
"Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown.",1
"  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last week.",1
"He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore defense.",1
"  Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00  Anders has lost the starting halfback job.",1
"Tony Richardson will reclaim that spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback.",1

Latest NFL Player News  ,1
"Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week.,1
"Seattle should roll up good numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the year.",1
"   Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00  Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long.",1
"But the Broncos' pass defense is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a chance to shine this week.",1
   ,1
"Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week.,1
"Last time the Seahawks faced Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.",1
"  John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Carney won't be much of a factor this week.",1
San Diego will have a very hard time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.,1
"  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Jones might have a quiet outing this week.",1
Baltimore is very aware he is San Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.,1
"  Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Don't expect much from Fletcher this week.,1
The true strength of Baltimore's defense is its ability to squash the run.,1
"The Ravens have shut down much more decorated backs all season long.    Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more problems on Sunday.",1
The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers.,1
"Under no cirumstances should you start him.     Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.",1
   ,1
"Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week.,1
"Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.",1
"  Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week.,1
He will be too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key third-down target.,1
  ,1
"Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week.,1
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets in the red zone.,1
"   Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Expect a big game from Brown this week.",1
"Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.",1
"  Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week.,1
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may need to use Crockett often against the Jets.,1
"   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00  Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week.",1
"Look for him to pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim Brown.",1
   ,1
"Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week.,1
Watters totaled more than 200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.,1
   ,1
"Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against the Panthers.,1
Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on Steve Beuerlein.,1
"  Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week.,1
The Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few chances to kick against Carolina.,1
"  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00  Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week.",1
"He is an accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.",1
"  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez.",1
"Look for the superstar TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not be able to contain him over the middle.",1
"  Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00  Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week.",1
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep routes.,1
"  Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00  Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina.",1
He should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.,1
"  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his injured right leg.,1
"An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said.",1
His injury is officially listed as a strained upper calf.,1
Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants defense.,1
"  Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week.",1
The Broncos will have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.,1
  ,1
"Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00  Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently.",1
"He should perform well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the middle.",1
"     Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00  Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week.",1
"He should put up good numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.",1
   ,1
"Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to play Sunday.",1
"Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown.",1
  ,1
"Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last week.",1
"He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore defense.",1
"  Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00  Anders has lost the starting halfback job.",1
"Tony Richardson will reclaim that spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback.",1
Frank Moreau will be used in short-yardage situations.,1
"Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas City RBs.",1
"  Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, but don't expect the same this week against the Colts.",1
Christie is a solid Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.,1
"  Sylvester Morris , WR KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics.",1
"""I missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, but it's still a long season,"" he said.",1
"""It's not so bad physically.",1
"But every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college.",1
"In college, you could schedule your classes.",1
I never had a class before 10 o'clock.,1
Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day.,1
"That's a difference.""",1

"Under no cirumstances should you start him.     Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.",1
   ,1
"Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00",1
 ,1
Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week.,1
"Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.",1
"  Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week.,1
He will be too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key third-down target.,1
"  Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00  ",1
The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week.,1
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets in the red zone.    ,1
"Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Expect a big game from Brown this week.,1
"Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.",1
"  Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week.,1
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may need to use Crockett often against the Jets.,1
"   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00  Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week.",1
"Look for him to pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim Brown.",1
   ,1
"Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00",1
 ,1
Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week.,1
Watters totaled more than 200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.,1
   ,1
"Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00",1
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against the Panthers.,1
Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on Steve Beuerlein.,1
"  Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  ",1
Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week.,1
The Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few chances to kick against Carolina.,1
"  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00  Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week.",1
"He is an accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.",1
"  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00  ",1
"Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez.",1
"Look for the superstar TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not be able to contain him over the middle.",1
"  Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week.",1
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep routes.,1
"  Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00  Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina.",1
He should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.,1
"  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his injured right leg.",1
"An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said.",1
His injury is officially listed as a strained upper calf.,1
Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants defense.,1
  ,1
"Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week.",1
The Broncos will have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.,1
"  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00  Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently.",1
"He should perform well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the middle.",1
"     Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00  Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week.",1
"He should put up good numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.",1
   ,1
"Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00  Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to play Sunday.",1
"Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown.",1
  ,1
"Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00  Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last week.",1
"He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore defense.",1
"  Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00  Anders has lost the starting halfback job.",1
"Tony Richardson will reclaim that spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback.",1
Frank Moreau will be used in short-yardage situations.,1
"Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas City RBs.",1
"  Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00  Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, but don't expect the same this week against the Colts.",1
Christie is a solid Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.,1
  ,1
"Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00  Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics.",1
"""I missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, but it's still a long season,"" he said.",1
"""It's not so bad physically.",1
"But every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college.",1
"In college, you could schedule your classes.",1
I never had a class before 10 o'clock.,1
Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day.,1
"That's a difference.""",1

"Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20",1
Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =at=20Milwaukee.,1

"Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.",1
=20Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.,1
 He is used primarily =as=20a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.,1

"Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20",1
"Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a==20sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven==20points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.",1
 Because Marshall comes off the=20bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.,1
 But with him back in the rotatio=n=20forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.,1
   ,1
=20,1
"Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.",1
 ,1
He==20is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  ,1
This could have positi=ve=20or negative affects on their production.,1
 If you have Houston frontcourt=20players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=er=20the current conditions.,1

"Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20",1
Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur==20on his right foot.,1
 The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.,1
 Rook=ie=20Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20Buckner.,1
  This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined==20with the same injury.,1
 Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=he=20season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.,1

"Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20",1
Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20Friday's game against Houston.,1

Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20straight games because of a calf injury.,1

 He is expected to play against the Wizards=20Thursday.  ,1

"Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20",1
Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit==20longer.,1

 Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=d=20be back in action in another two weeks.,1
 He has been sidelined since the=20first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.,1
 Trent is a goo=d=20inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  ,1

TO ALL ELECTION INTEGRITY INTERNET ACTIVISTS:Keep it up!,1
The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.,1
It's only a matter of time before they're going to have toback off on their support for Al Gore and join the call forhim to concede.,1
"For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayorof El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliationfrom Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirtytactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.",1
"Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, ""Over 600,000 servicemenand women gave their lives in this last century to ensureAmerican freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.",1
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this sameright.,1
"I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when theleader of the Democratic Party, supported by other electedDemocrat officials take this position.",1
This is the finalstraw.,1
"I didn't leave my party - my party left me.""It",1
's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore andeven elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.,1
And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.,1
 Disenfranchising themilitary is as low as you sink.,1
 ,1
As American citizens we owea debt of gratitude to the military.,1
The least we can do is defend their fundamental right tovote.,1

"Hi Folks,?I'll?have the full blown matchups very late  tonight / Friday morning but for you last minute waiver wire watchers, here's  something you might be interested in:?",1
Chris Warren might be worth a shot  as the Eagles have signed him as anticipated according to the AP.?,1
Full  article is below.?,1
I'm betting he's still got something left in the  tank.?,1
I'm also betting coach Andy Reid is smart enough to figure a way for  him to contribute in some fashion.,1
McNabb is not a QB that must be overly  protected so the fact Warren may not know all the pass protection blocks isn't  quite as critical as it normally is.?,1
He could be worth a  ,1
shot.?See you,1
"Friday morning,?Joe????From the article: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/eagles/thurs.htm?",1
 The Philadelphia  Eagles have said for weeks that they're not looking ahead to the NFL playoffs.  ,1
"But by adding recently waived running back Chris Warren on Thursday, the Eagles  may be thinking about what they need to succeed if they reach the postseason.",1
 The Eagles claimed Warren one day after he was waived by the Dallas Cowboys.,1
" Warren, in his 11th NFL season,  will join the Eagles for Friday's practice and will be available Sunday against  the Cleveland Browns.",1
"''He's been in the league 11 years and at one  point he was one of the best backs in the game,'' Eagles head coach Andy Reid  said.",1
''Is he that now?,1
I don't know.,1
But he's a big back who has played well  this season.'',1
"In Dallas this season, Warren rushed for 254 yards and  two touchdowns and averaged 4.3 yards per carry He also caught 31 passes for 302  yards and a touchdown.",1
"But in last Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay, Warren  misplayed a pass that deflected off his hands and was intercepted and returned  for a touchdown.",1
"He was benched after that play, and then was involved in a  shouting match with a Dallas coach on the sideline.",1
"Three days later, he  was waived.",1
"Dallas owner Jerry Jones said Warren ''wasn't in the plans moving  forward,'' but Warren said he was cut because he wouldn't accept a one-year  contract extension for 2001 at his current salary, $715,000.",1
Now Warren  is an Eagle.,1
Philadelphia is looking to add a spark to a running game that has  been struggling since the season-ending injury to running back Duce Staley in  October.,1
"The running-back-by-committee group of Darnell Autry, Stanley  Pritchett and Brian Mitchell has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in the  last four games.",1
"Philadelphia, 9-5 and needing just one win in games against  Cleveland and Cincinnati to make the playoffs for the first time since 1996,",1
has  ,1
relied on quarterback Donovan McNabb almost exclusively to make the offense go.,1
 McNabb is averaging nearly 75% of the team's total offensive output.,1
" Warren began his NFL career in Seattle and ran for more than 1,000 yards  in four consecutive seasons, 1992-95.",1
He made three Pro Bowls during that time.,1
" Seattle's career leading ground gainer, Warren has 7,654 yards rushing  in his career, which began in 1990.",1
Warren signed with Dallas as an  unrestricted free agent prior to the 1998 season.,1
He has been a backup behind  Emmitt Smith the last three seasons.,1
"To make room on the active roster,  the Eagles waived wide receiver Alex Van Dyke.",1

An increasingly desperate Al Gore called for a recount Tuesday of the U.S. Supreme Court's 9-0 decision in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board.,1
"""There is reason to suspect that these nine votes were not properly counted and that as many as five justices who sided with Mr. Bush did not intend to do so,"" Gore said.",1
"""It is therefore in the best interest of our democracy for the U.S. Supreme Court to suspend judgment in this case until we can be absolutely certain that this court did, in fact, intend to rule in Mr. Bush's favor.""",1
"Gore added that if his recount request is denied, he will file an appeal with the Interplanetary Supreme Court.",1
